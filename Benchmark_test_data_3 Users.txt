11/01/23, 14:46 - User B  :Lovely places to buy from but very hard to get a good price as a seller because of their high rents (and bargaining expertise!)
11/01/23, 18:16 - User C :They keep leaving [NAME] open üòÇ
11/01/23, 18:16 - User A :I agree you need to plan ahead. But you can't build infrastructure that will be heavily under-utilised and drive you broke to make.

07/02/23, 12:04 - User A :We're not really meant to be close friends and have sex with someone without feeling anything. You're defying nature by attempting to.

18/03/23, 11:21 - User B  :These are the kinds of dudes that gillette ad is talking about.
18/03/23, 11:21 - User C :Lol I bet you actually believe that too
18/03/23, 21:09 - User A :... I don't feel like your comment is from an objective point of view... Thanks though.

07/04/23, 05:21 - User A :Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.
07/04/23, 21:56 - User B  :Wow. Did not realize [NAME] was a top 20
10/04/23, 13:03 - User C :That makes sense. You had a good reaction time. Glad no one was hurt.
11/04/23, 09:21 - User A :There's ignite on the lane too, that's an upkeep kill on censor. I agree that horn into coup could have been a better play though.
20/04/23, 12:38 - User B  :Approaching doesn't work unless you are [NAME] or something. I've only seen 2 approaches in my life and both were rejections.

04/05/23, 15:21 - User B  :Difference between city and rural. In Toronto, if you indicate there's no way anyone's going to let you in. Signals show weakness.
04/05/23, 15:21 - User C :Wow. [NAME] is a giant POS. He'll be really happy being single and dying alone.
04/05/23, 15:21 - User A :Thank you so much for all this! Nobody else seemed to understand the situation and just tell me to eat better, which I already do.
06/05/23, 10:22 - User B  :Right? He actually came across as level headed and mature here so that was a shock.
06/05/23, 10:23 - User C :It's disturbing that you even have to ask that.
06/05/23, 10:23 - User A :Back up, [NAME]!
06/05/23, 10:24 - User B  :if [NAME] got a divorce he would stop doing this
06/05/23, 10:26 - User C :Hey, thank you. :) I appreciate it.
06/05/23, 10:27 - User A :And it‚Äôs only 100 degrees with 90% humidity.
06/05/23, 10:27 - User B  :That looks like food for a 12 year old.
06/05/23, 10:28 - User C :I agree. I've been passively thinking that the left and right axis is irrelevant. Its north and south that divides
06/05/23, 10:37 - User A :Bless you.
06/05/23, 12:39 - User B  :If there is an ordered psychological work-up, will it be 3 days and 3 nights and will they decide if she needs to stay longer? thank you

09/05/23, 18:46 - User A :[NAME] my God. That was the best free throw shooting ive ever seen.
09/05/23, 18:46 - User B  :This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.
10/05/23, 15:34 - User C :Isn't that the point though? That's it's up to the people that aren't scientist to decide if the science has any meaning?
10/05/23, 15:34 - User A :Sorry your right

17/05/23, 13:55 - User A :So happy to see these as the top two comments. My lips turned to prunes just watching this.
17/05/23, 13:57 - User B  :A bash that doesn‚Äôt guaranty anything? Isn‚Äôt that a bad thing I mean it‚Äôs one of the complaints of heard about lawbringers shove
17/05/23, 13:57 - User C :Rawr! (That means I love you in dinosaur!)
17/05/23, 13:58 - User A :Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense.
17/05/23, 13:58 - User B  :Reminds me of when we used to have an RB named [NAME] while [NAME] was at Texas
17/05/23, 13:59 - User C :What's your point? All these comments are from people who clearly had not seen it before. Only a couple said they had.
17/05/23, 13:59 - User A :Every single time a person has demanded to see an MD rather than me I have appreciated the dodged bullet. It's never fun for the physician.

17/05/23, 16:21 - User A :I don‚Äôt know why but this made me crack up so hard!
17/05/23, 16:22 - User B  :Had to sober up before I could figure out YouTube, but that was amazing.
17/05/23, 16:22 - User C :Here is the original post
17/05/23, 16:22 - User A :What a waste of plastic.
17/05/23, 16:23 - User B  :It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
17/05/23, 16:23 - User C :I dont really know, I think its mostly because they just get these really high end computers and do nothing with them.
17/05/23, 16:24 - User A :I wish I was [NAME]. Source (deleted):
17/05/23, 16:25 - User B  :I woulda "sneezed" with my drink in my hand and launched it right behind me
17/05/23, 16:25 - User C :Will they ever stop?? FLG is a cult.
17/05/23, 16:26 - User A :Original:
17/05/23, 16:27 - User B  :I‚Äôm really glad [NAME] wasn‚Äôt [NAME]
17/05/23, 16:28 - User C :Imperial is already messy and hard to understand
17/05/23, 16:28 - User A :YPG has carried out numerous attacks. Yet you seem to judge them on the few messed up things they have done.
17/05/23, 16:29 - User B  :Lol I can‚Äôt wait to end up on this sub one day.
17/05/23, 16:32 - User C :Wish I was this happy

17/05/23, 16:40 - User B  :I am a dishonest and disrespectul
17/05/23, 16:41 - User C :He should really let [NAME] come inside him
17/05/23, 16:43 - User A :Are they bigger than our defensive breakdowns and [NAME] five hole?
17/05/23, 16:46 - User B  :I think they should have gone with ‚ÄúBreaking news: even healthcare professional can‚Äôt see the future.‚Äù
17/05/23, 16:49 - User C :You still haven't shown any evidence of racism outside your own mind.
17/05/23, 17:00 - User A :Let‚Äôs go! TRoss is awesome
17/05/23, 17:03 - User B  :Exactly, thank you. 
17/05/23, 17:15 - User C :I know it‚Äôs crazy, but I think it would work and they would probably understand 
17/05/23, 17:17 - User A :Proof of age is reasonable, but having to prove identity to enter is just appalling.
17/05/23, 17:18 - User B  :2 Minute [NAME] is the scariest [NAME]. I fear they have yet again, like the regular season game, scored too soon.
17/05/23, 17:19 - User C :I'm afraid of having a sit down with them amd not being heard. But I might have to for my safety.
17/05/23, 17:33 - User A :That must hurt
17/05/23, 17:40 - User B  :That windshield crack from his skull!
17/05/23, 17:46 - User C :Ugh. I wish you were wrong.
17/05/23, 17:51 - User A :I would go to bed early and I would have nothing to do the 3-4 nights a week I play tennis lol
17/05/23, 18:05 - User B  :We have 9 home games which is awesome.
17/05/23, 18:42 - User C :Wrong. Im a [NAME].
17/05/23, 18:42 - User A :That's a maryland fan comment. You should be ashamed of yourself.
17/05/23, 18:54 - User B  :Clearly it's all the Big Pharma in the Monsanto‚Ñ¢. I heard at least two of those kids had three Monsantos‚Ñ¢, EACH! 
17/05/23, 18:54 - User C :I like this, but it doesn‚Äôt quite convey the horrifying rotting smell. It sounds sort of cute! She was not lol 
17/05/23, 19:00 - User A :I want to change though. If I'm around those people I will remain the same way. Right?
17/05/23, 19:54 - User B  :I am sad to hear about your cat. Pets become like a family member. I am glad to hear you are doing better.
17/05/23, 20:11 - User C :That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.
17/05/23, 20:14 - User A :c'mon OP, I know you would have liked to see that
17/05/23, 20:14 - User B  :I will! This is a great new excuse for never leaving my house
17/05/23, 20:14 - User C :The only death that made me feel any emotion. And it wasn‚Äôt even the death itself.
17/05/23, 20:16 - User A :Oh because all fruiting plants were bred by humans, ok TIL
17/05/23, 20:16 - User B  :Back in my day, we didn't even need language to survive! Animals just roamed around, making different sounds depending on context! 
17/05/23, 20:16 - User C :I can help out, pm me :)
17/05/23, 20:17 - User A :Oh. You‚Äôre one of.... ^*those.*
17/05/23, 20:17 - User B  :He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.
17/05/23, 20:19 - User C :I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
17/05/23, 20:25 - User A :It wasn't about your syllable count. It was about how nobody ever calls it "text-interpretation." It's called "reading comprehension."
17/05/23, 20:37 - User B  :Why would I do that?
18/05/23, 08:27 - User C :[NAME] career ended after he broke his foot when he kicked a seat while blacked out on a party after a Vikings game.
18/05/23, 08:38 - User A :[NAME] Immediately thought of you when I saw this thread. Can‚Äôt stop laughing. But. I‚Äôll wear yours someday and no others
18/05/23, 08:39 - User B  :Firemen make roughly 30000¬£ in UK today.
18/05/23, 10:30 - User C :Walkerton for anyone who is curious about the actual real deaths under "chainsaw" [NAME] 
18/05/23, 10:32 - User A :Now let's just hope session also becomes season.
18/05/23, 10:36 - User B  :It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
18/05/23, 10:36 - User C :that‚Äôs a brilliant photo, your torny looks younger than my one! so cute
18/05/23, 10:36 - User A :But she still looking like late twenties
18/05/23, 10:38 - User B  :this is my dream
18/05/23, 10:38 - User C :It's horrible and I love it and you should be proud.
18/05/23, 10:38 - User A :Huge, huge internet hugs. My heart broke for you reading this. I'm so sorry you had to go through this. 
18/05/23, 10:41 - User B  :I like you.
18/05/23, 10:45 - User C :Get a ride to heaven. You think [NAME] wants to pedal that far!
18/05/23, 10:46 - User A :Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?
18/05/23, 10:47 - User B  :No worries, thanks for replying back! Rotary means you teach one subject and see different classes instead of teaching multiple subjects to the same class :)
18/05/23, 10:47 - User C :Thank you, next! 
18/05/23, 12:24 - User A :I have the worst memory ever. Idk if it's from all the weed I smoked but I also have a blank mind like all the time.
18/05/23, 17:19 - User B  ::) I like this.
18/05/23, 17:33 - User C :Idk, looks more like [NAME] to me, the fact he goes straight in for the hug is what sells me
19/05/23, 17:01 - User A :Because they are triggered. I‚Äôm just stating my opinion. It‚Äôs a bit fun.
19/05/23, 17:08 - User B  :That‚Äôs the silver lining of this. Fuck Veracruz.
19/05/23, 17:15 - User C :Thank you for all of the tips. It's greatly appreciated!
19/05/23, 17:15 - User A :[NAME] is known to make a short video hella fucking long. Not many want to see even more people do that. I'll stick to [NAME].
19/05/23, 17:16 - User B  :He does hate [NAME] though. And [NAME] gets promoted.
19/05/23, 17:17 - User C :I doubt I'll ever own one of those, I'm a bookworm and I love the smell of old books. Thanks for the info, nonetheless.
19/05/23, 17:18 - User A :What do you mean by delicate flowers?
19/05/23, 17:36 - User B  :They probably didn't know.
19/05/23, 17:36 - User C :[NAME] today is great, when he plays like this he is a rly good player
19/05/23, 17:41 - User A :Don't worry you'll outlive them.
19/05/23, 17:45 - User B  :This is clearly the world's most dangerous gang
19/05/23, 17:45 - User C :Saves me going out to buy toilet paper today
19/05/23, 17:48 - User A :Which one? I like their podcast but I can totally see why a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt hahaha
19/05/23, 17:48 - User B  :I am really excited for you! We texted a few weeks before we met too! The first hugs and kisses were the best!
19/05/23, 17:49 - User C :Situation in chess where it is better not to move or you will end up in a worse position is called Zugzwang.
19/05/23, 17:50 - User A :Thanks, going to check them out next time i make something like chilli
19/05/23, 17:50 - User B  :Everyone in this video is annoying. This seems like a terrible place to go hang out.
19/05/23, 17:50 - User C :This would be very much appreciated.
19/05/23, 17:51 - User A :I live here! Apparently I need to be keeping my eyes open.
19/05/23, 17:52 - User B  :He‚Äôs probably just getting stressed out that it is now getting dark and he lives in the countryside
19/05/23, 17:54 - User C :Careful, you are almost criticizing your god in chief. Your friends at TD will probably ban you for that.
19/05/23, 17:56 - User A :I wish more people enjoyed that sport.. when that clay explodes you get that FEEL
19/05/23, 18:09 - User B  :Well it depends on your level, class, and how good you roll.
19/05/23, 18:13 - User C :Honestly you should have gone nuclear on him
19/05/23, 18:15 - User A :Really wanted him on the Mets. But, its gonna be fun watching [NAME] try to catch [NAME] slider. 
19/05/23, 18:15 - User B  :Now I'm over thinking. Maybe I have justified it to be able to move on and get closure???
19/05/23, 18:16 - User C :That‚Äôs so scummy, I‚Äôm hoping the pepperoni just slid down? 
19/05/23, 18:16 - User A :Thanks [NAME] for holding on to our $17.5M. We will be needing that back though.
19/05/23, 18:16 - User B  :The essay is optional.
19/05/23, 18:17 - User C :I need a do over!!!! At least I‚Äôm not the only one lol, solidarity ‚úåÔ∏è
19/05/23, 18:18 - User A :literally wasn‚Äôt the worst effort of the season
19/05/23, 18:18 - User B  :I want this back "I want us back" I missed the part where that's my problem
19/05/23, 18:18 - User C :i got kangaroo from the meat guys over in U district at University Seafood and Poultry. they have tons of exotic stuff
19/05/23, 18:19 - User A :I may be wrong but I think cows are stronger than horses, or at least made to be 
19/05/23, 18:20 - User B  :Yes, you‚Äôre right. Thank you for your kind words.
19/05/23, 18:23 - User C :I mean do what you want but I've always thought that's a good way of getting pink eye.
19/05/23, 18:24 - User A :I love the content the PC channel puts out, its what wwe's channel should do more of
19/05/23, 18:25 - User B  :Good thing there‚Äôs someone sensible in the Whitehouse.
19/05/23, 18:25 - User C :Makes sense. So I need 2 USB drives according the the TAILS website.
19/05/23, 18:26 - User A :Thank you for sharing this. I found my house in 1938. Very fascinating stuff :)
19/05/23, 18:26 - User B  :Tell [NAME] it was me....
19/05/23, 18:26 - User C :Xers and [NAME] would be more of age in the 90‚Äôs doh, signed [NAME]. 
19/05/23, 18:27 - User A :Maybe you should smoke some and relax.
19/05/23, 18:28 - User B  :Good Job
19/05/23, 18:30 - User C :why are you a detective all of a sudden
19/05/23, 18:30 - User A :I think [NAME] said it best. When two people watch the same video and see completely different events....there's no fixing that.
19/05/23, 18:31 - User B  :Nah I think you're just feeling confident because you got a slamming deal on those clothes! I would feel the same way!
19/05/23, 18:32 - User C :That's a good idea, I'm going to have to make some room! Thank you. 
19/05/23, 18:32 - User A :I know, there isn't even a 7 in it.
19/05/23, 18:33 - User B  :[NAME] is the gift we all deserve
19/05/23, 18:34 - User C :Oh dear, The combination of drugs, alcohol and a cell phone has caused many regrets. 
19/05/23, 18:34 - User A :I call [NAME] fraud! That's not the first time she saw [NAME] after prison.
19/05/23, 18:37 - User B  :This is really well put. I saved it.
19/05/23, 18:37 - User C :[NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.
19/05/23, 18:38 - User A :A comb that combs near and far. Great for rushed carpools to work.
19/05/23, 18:38 - User B  :they are needlepoint, excellent tabs. i've gained his trust and toured the lab. this is no weak shit. thanks for the info.
19/05/23, 18:38 - User C :I don't have a smart phone; however, I wouldn't need one in this case.
19/05/23, 18:38 - User A :Yeah it‚Äôs pretty cringe tbh, I think he‚Äôs a good guy just a little insecure 
19/05/23, 18:43 - User B  :Oh. Sorry.
19/05/23, 18:43 - User C :This is beautiful and heartbreaking :(
19/05/23, 18:43 - User A :you‚Äôre beautiful
19/05/23, 18:43 - User B  :One thing I appreciate about the Prequel trilogy is that it explores the rise of fascism better than *Fantastic Beasts* movies could do.
19/05/23, 18:44 - User C :I took it as a woke/edgy joke. Don't admit it was just a typo!!!
19/05/23, 18:45 - User A :fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
19/05/23, 18:46 - User B  :But how can someone not be gender critical and yet claim to be a radical feminist? I‚Äôm genuinely confused.
19/05/23, 18:46 - User C :Orange you just soo cute.
19/05/23, 18:48 - User A :Beans, yo! I used to hate them but now I sometimes just eat a can of beans for a meal. They are hella filling too.
19/05/23, 18:48 - User B  :Pretty sure it was New Orleans.
19/05/23, 18:48 - User C :Uhhhh I did lol
19/05/23, 18:49 - User A :And that's not [NAME] either. It's former HS o-lineman who now runs a frat
19/05/23, 18:50 - User B  :No thanks.
19/05/23, 18:50 - User C :Yes, risky. In fact don't click it at all.
19/05/23, 18:50 - User A :Especially after the debacle with [NAME] on "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan."
19/05/23, 18:52 - User B  :Aha, I didn't say that was a good thing.
19/05/23, 18:52 - User C :I don't get it. Maybe i need to position myself better to get dibs on batches. I literally have only made $60 a week.
19/05/23, 18:53 - User A :And you assume they are part of the dominant culture because of the color of their skin. That is self evident racism.
19/05/23, 19:02 - User B  :Worried me there
19/05/23, 19:02 - User C :Wow thanks I would've never figured out that you were sarcastic without that /s
19/05/23, 19:03 - User A :You're going to be free one day, but never if you stop trying. Every weeks a new week, goodluck !
19/05/23, 19:04 - User B  :Seriously?
19/05/23, 19:05 - User C :ironic/profoundly tragic. tomato/to-mah-to
19/05/23, 19:09 - User A :Imagine watching yourself back and still being unable to see why you were eliminated
19/05/23, 19:10 - User B  :The DPRK is ethno fascism
19/05/23, 19:11 - User C :But how's that a facepalm? Editing the hands is not that crazy.
19/05/23, 19:11 - User A :Oof, thanks
19/05/23, 19:11 - User B  :Uhh..class 4 is unknown dental class after 13th month without exam or no initial exam. *sorry*
19/05/23, 19:13 - User C :THATS WHAT SHE SAID...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
19/05/23, 19:16 - User A :Hope this scenario changes for the better. Else non affiliated scholars might overtake the academia in ushering real breakthroughs that would change the game.
19/05/23, 19:20 - User B  :PS4 but thank you anyway
19/05/23, 19:21 - User C :It was more of a joke. I still have hope for [NAME]. Just kind of a tough sell at this point.
19/05/23, 19:21 - User A :We need another goal to show for it. Come on boys.
19/05/23, 19:21 - User B  :Wow, your ex partner sounds exactly like mine.
19/05/23, 19:21 - User C :How pretentious do you have to be to say ‚Äúidk if you know who that is tho‚Äù after saying what your favourite band is
19/05/23, 19:22 - User A :Arguably. It is undefined.
19/05/23, 19:22 - User B  :Aaaand I'm still here. I don't have a alt account but whoever you reported I"m sure is alive and well. You're terrible.
19/05/23, 19:23 - User C :The Nashville Design is just a placeholder. The actual plans have yet to been finalized.
19/05/23, 19:23 - User A :I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.
19/05/23, 19:24 - User B  :Welp , that statement is not very wrong.
19/05/23, 19:25 - User C :Poetic justice they get to the title game host Philly and BDN whips it out for them and shoves it down their throat. That would be epic.
19/05/23, 19:28 - User A :errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well.
19/05/23, 19:29 - User B  :Ahh change.org, where change goes to...do nothing
19/05/23, 19:29 - User C :i feel ya
19/05/23, 19:38 - User A :Please do. lol
19/05/23, 19:42 - User B  :This is the only viable way out of Brexit.
19/05/23, 19:42 - User C :I've also heard that intriguing but also kinda scary
19/05/23, 19:44 - User A :If you don't believe the government has the power to restrict things, you're not a liberal, you're an anarchist or a libertarian.
19/05/23, 19:44 - User B  :I was going to suggest that as well, but I still need this whole "elopement" thing explained to me.
19/05/23, 19:45 - User C :I'm sad for the bot. They only want a purpose
19/05/23, 19:48 - User A :This kid is blatantly trolling and everyone is taking him seriously LMAO. You people should quit Salem your scum reading skills are horrible
19/05/23, 19:48 - User B  :Honestly wish [NAME] would just stop taking threes all together. They just don‚Äôt fall for him.
19/05/23, 19:49 - User C :I try I do but I retreat to my bed every time because I can‚Äôt handle it
19/05/23, 19:49 - User A :I didn't read the entire article. That's great. Thanks for letting me know. Peace and happy 2019
19/05/23, 19:50 - User B  :Don't forget [NAME] being nerfed because she was unfun to play against in QM, then being reworked, then being nerfed again for the same reason.
19/05/23, 19:51 - User C :I just draw for the fun of it tbh... But having "success" or getting recognition still surely feels nice... Don't give up :)!
19/05/23, 19:55 - User A :Never take advice from someone named "poor judgement" 
19/05/23, 19:56 - User B  :California cheeseburger.
19/05/23, 19:59 - User C :Now her child will walk around smelling like onion
19/05/23, 20:00 - User A :Jeez, I was joking
19/05/23, 20:02 - User B  :There it is!
19/05/23, 20:02 - User C :Women, in the modern world, know how to fight these weasels. We need many more women in positions of power.
19/05/23, 20:03 - User A :Just think of it as set in an alternate universe where America didn‚Äôt just take independence but went back to England and established their own colonies there.
19/05/23, 20:04 - User B  :I still think we didn't give the guy a fair shot to coach.
19/05/23, 20:06 - User C :The best LGBTQ+ FILM i have seen in years.
19/05/23, 20:07 - User A :It's ok, it's just Gypsy Danger
19/05/23, 20:10 - User B  :Surely hope so, buddy. Surely hope so.
19/05/23, 20:12 - User C :Excellent collage, I learned so much from all these guys. The community is great, the unconfiscatable conference was awesome üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
19/05/23, 20:13 - User A :Its a half baked RP. If they wanted to kill each other they oculd have just started shooting.
19/05/23, 20:14 - User B  :Praying to [NAME] üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm going to use that!
19/05/23, 20:16 - User C :[NAME] is such a disgusting champ to play against ....
19/05/23, 20:18 - User A :Evil spirit! Leave from this place and never return!!
19/05/23, 20:18 - User B  :Looks interesting, I'll definitely keep an eye out for it when it's closer to release. 
19/05/23, 20:19 - User C :That's the impression I've always had, but man the owner gets snippy if you disagree on your review!
19/05/23, 20:34 - User A :Well isn‚Äôt it pretty much just standard goblin lore? Not like she came up with gold/ greedy goblin background on her own.
19/05/23, 20:35 - User B  :Best sub ever
19/05/23, 20:36 - User C :It's impossible for communism to exist without a state.
19/05/23, 20:40 - User A :I played that one. It was really fun(at least to me, as a kid).
19/05/23, 20:41 - User B  :So true. The chicks I pick up from clubbing are nothing compared to the love of a good woman.
19/05/23, 20:42 - User C :What was that?!
19/05/23, 20:43 - User A :Cured her depression, didn't it? 
19/05/23, 20:46 - User B  :That was what was most nauseating for me honestly. Not a single period used once.
19/05/23, 20:48 - User C :True enough. I'd love more LGBT friendly horror.
19/05/23, 20:49 - User A :I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
19/05/23, 20:59 - User B  :No, but it changes the expectations that people have for you. You have so deliberately change who you are to play to your target audience.
19/05/23, 21:01 - User C :That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
19/05/23, 21:04 - User A :It was my wedding song!
19/05/23, 21:05 - User B  :Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
19/05/23, 21:07 - User C :Apparently, they couldn't believe a massive corporation (that they're loyal to) finally called them out.
19/05/23, 21:11 - User A :Themmuns have everywhere infiltrated so they do !
19/05/23, 21:19 - User B  :Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky "shadowban" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh
19/05/23, 21:20 - User C :I‚Äôd be verrrrrrrry nervous if we hired him. Would love him as an OC tho
19/05/23, 21:21 - User A :Actually looks really fucking fun. Where can I do this?
19/05/23, 21:21 - User B  :That‚Äôs awesome! Heal up quickly
19/05/23, 21:21 - User C :hahah if only he had reddit
19/05/23, 21:21 - User A :Oh wow. Didn‚Äôt realize it was that broad.

19/05/23, 21:24 - User C :[NAME] stop thinking too much and just do stuff like that
19/05/23, 21:28 - User A :On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto.
19/05/23, 21:31 - User B  :Funny thing is, I got mine today. Maybe it'll stop tonight?
19/05/23, 21:31 - User C :[NAME] is his ex.
19/05/23, 21:34 - User A :I don't know, they'd have to reduce the accuracy of the NPCs a bit then cause I sure don't like 1-shotters using aimbot
19/05/23, 21:35 - User B  :oh yeah? Mines real
19/05/23, 21:36 - User C :Can't relate because the sadness and loneliness is constant üòé
19/05/23, 21:36 - User A :I'm not but there's a difference between criticism and constant, unrelenting negativity.
19/05/23, 21:38 - User B  :Everyone‚Äôs been assuming that‚Äôs there problem all week anyways haha
19/05/23, 21:39 - User C :Mom used to do it all time when I was a kid.
19/05/23, 21:43 - User A :You cant pick and choose racism you dippy cunt
19/05/23, 21:45 - User B  :You tried your best, and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.
19/05/23, 21:48 - User C :>The only person who said the CIBC cheques were not cashed is from Quadriga. I believe [NAME] said the same when interviewed for the coindesk article.
19/05/23, 21:53 - User A :Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy
19/05/23, 22:00 - User B  :Wow, who can afford this one?

19/05/23, 22:18 - User C :Works for me. The video is called : The great porn experiment | [NAME] | TEDxGlasgow
19/05/23, 22:18 - User A :Thank you for answering me, I did ask him Straight forward but he just told me is busy 
19/05/23, 22:18 - User B  :Very good post brother you hit the nail on the head. It is unfortunate that people downvote this post to the bottom when you explain so well.
19/05/23, 22:20 - User C :If she hasn‚Äôt told you where she lives it‚Äôs too soon to send flowers...in my opinion.
19/05/23, 22:22 - User A :Weird we‚Äôve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn‚Äôt become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
19/05/23, 22:28 - User B  :You deserve it <3
19/05/23, 22:32 - User C :Dying to find out who it is
19/05/23, 22:35 - User A :You're not wrong. We move better in a chaotic atmosphere rather than a structured one.
19/05/23, 22:46 - User B  :If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen.
19/05/23, 22:47 - User C :this is awesome
19/05/23, 22:48 - User A :One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.
19/05/23, 22:54 - User B  :Wow, you people...
19/05/23, 23:07 - User C :He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
19/05/23, 23:07 - User A :Where do you think it belongs? Why?
19/05/23, 23:08 - User B  :Apparently America is 400 years old according to him as well.
19/05/23, 23:19 - User C :Thought he dislocated his shoulder at first
20/05/23, 07:45 - User A :Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
20/05/23, 07:45 - User B  :Really? wow. I just reinstalled chrome from scratch, again. So it was Ghostery that caused the full screen issues?

20/05/23, 07:53 - User B  :I still gotta watch the last one. ‚òπ
20/05/23, 07:57 - User C :Nope. This is shown with [NAME] spider-man having reversed version of the Raimiverse spider-man, a la the upside down kiss having [NAME] on the bottom instead.
20/05/23, 07:57 - User A :I'm asexual too, so I'm doubly protected against advertisements.
20/05/23, 08:01 - User B  :I know, right? I mean I liked Le Tigre, but this is just damn embarassing.
20/05/23, 08:03 - User C :Should be Colt Wesley Small Johnson

20/05/23, 08:20 - User A :I'm cracking up at my desk now, thanks
20/05/23, 08:21 - User B  :Also a throwback to when [NAME] bathed.
20/05/23, 08:21 - User C :When we have tens of millions starving or dying of thirst, at least you will still have the moral 'high ground'.
20/05/23, 08:22 - User A :The lunatic is on the grass.
20/05/23, 08:26 - User B  :Didn't know you're that close of a friend.. very cool!

20/05/23, 09:29 - User B  :I‚Äôd love it if the Star Wars license was revoked from EA and then Obsidian make another KOTOR game.

20/05/23, 09:37 - User C :Great post thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
20/05/23, 09:38 - User A :Could be an attainability thing. My personality is very aloof and I tend to have much better results with more confident girls in general.

20/05/23, 09:51 - User C :[NAME] is getting the shit beat out of him and can't get a call

20/05/23, 10:35 - User B  :Considering you could do it and be out over a highschool summer vacation, why not?
20/05/23, 10:35 - User C :Checking in from Nashville, a merged city-county that‚Äôs thriving precisely because it‚Äôs a merged city/county.
20/05/23, 10:36 - User A :Could've done this last year and got [NAME]. I'm just praying we pick in the top 3

20/05/23, 10:45 - User B  :She looks like her face is pulled back with ''face lifts'' tape. Or like she's pulling back her face like that scene in MIB I.
20/05/23, 10:45 - User C :Sorry, I should have clarified that I meant when they determine your eligibility/payments in regards to the Repayment Assistance Program.
20/05/23, 10:45 - User A :It's delicate, so it's clear for those flesh toned jeggings [NAME].
20/05/23, 10:46 - User B  :It‚Äôs not clear to me that vulnerability functions as an ethical compass. Will table further replies in deference to a culture war thread.

20/05/23, 11:01 - User B  :That's what I came here for, thanks
20/05/23, 11:01 - User C :I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.
20/05/23, 11:05 - User A :Play hard, but we don't want to reveal our secret raptor killing strategy until the playoffs...
20/05/23, 11:07 - User B  :Ok, care to elaborate on what your mysterious link is?

20/05/23, 11:07 - User A :Dementia is in my family so this is pretty exciting. I also have to wonder if this bacteria could cause other kinds of mental illnesses..

20/05/23, 11:15 - User A :Haha, why are you still thinking about that? That's super weird.
20/05/23, 11:17 - User B  :I mean they still managed to say [NAME].

20/05/23, 11:36 - User A :Thank you so much! I know I deserve better, it just hard moving on and knowing that it‚Äôs finished.

20/05/23, 11:52 - User B  :I‚Äôm sorry to hear that friend :(. It‚Äôs for the best most likely if she didn‚Äôt accept you for who you are
20/05/23, 11:53 - User C :Get ready for one of those tail butt plug things

20/05/23, 12:26 - User C :Sphh, that was badass. I say that went well.
20/05/23, 12:26 - User A :Why it's bad for a union rep to be siding with ownership in the middle of a contract dispute on Twitter of all places?
20/05/23, 12:30 - User B  :my god quit getting blocked
20/05/23, 12:32 - User C :Going by it's [NAME] rating though, the district should be leaning blue. 
20/05/23, 12:34 - User A :Yes. Some shows get canceled before they can even finish the season

20/05/23, 12:58 - User C :the knock off names are super cringey but i love looking for them

20/05/23, 13:08 - User A :Maybe she'll finish Wardenclyffe Tower and stop Slappy and his monsters!
20/05/23, 13:09 - User B  :The problem is complex but in the 60's til now we where facing major propaganda against marijuana and this stuck to the head of most poeple.
20/05/23, 13:12 - User C :When you call someone trash and he easily beats you, what does that make you? lol
20/05/23, 13:13 - User A :wE mODiFieD eiGHT viDEo CaRds tO fIt iN A SinGLe pciE sLoT /squeak Whoops, sorry, wrong [NAME].

20/05/23, 13:19 - User B  :makeup call lol
20/05/23, 13:35 - User C :Imagine seriously considering [NAME] as a nominee, what a joke.
20/05/23, 13:37 - User A :I don't know why you even talk to human trash like this. Instead you should motivate him to leave her - at least that would be productive.
20/05/23, 13:40 - User B  :They are elected to represent Scotland
20/05/23, 13:42 - User C :No one ever laid on their death bed and said, ‚ÄúI regret not working even harder.‚Äù
20/05/23, 13:42 - User A :Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
20/05/23, 13:43 - User B  :She sounds abusive and narcissistic. Delete your facebook, hit the gym and kill her. 
20/05/23, 13:43 - User C :Or embalmed! Green burial is the best burial
20/05/23, 13:43 - User A :Shame ,your quite cute 
20/05/23, 13:44 - User B  :And here I am thinking that the animation after surrender/Victory is annoying ;-;
20/05/23, 13:57 - User C :It means less when you hear words come out of her foul mouth. Almost incomprehensible.
20/05/23, 14:15 - User A :Don‚Äôt be saucy with me, mister! I ain‚Äôt Alfredo you! 
20/05/23, 14:24 - User B  :How about a downvote for the update?

20/05/23, 15:07 - User A :Lmao what a guy
20/05/23, 15:20 - User B  :[NAME] has a very high release point. He throws like a 6'3" QB, he also has a Giant hands
20/05/23, 15:42 - User C :He looks normal. This entire post is a massive reach
20/05/23, 15:47 - User A :I love this show but I feel personally attacked when they say you can't live with 6 cups of tea a day and no food üò¢
20/05/23, 15:49 - User B  :Good luck for everyone pronouncing [NAME] name. If he keeps scoring like this, i'll have fun listening some commentators around NHL.
20/05/23, 15:51 - User C :Chills. I can‚Äôt wait. I‚Äôm sure [NAME] will get over this not being happy because they have bigger fish to fry.
20/05/23, 17:15 - User A :Kinda sad but... Okay then
20/05/23, 17:16 - User B  :It‚Äôs the NRA, I don‚Äôt think it should shock anyone regardless.
20/05/23, 17:18 - User C :Winter isn't even that bad here.
20/05/23, 17:18 - User A :HAHA WE ACTUALLY ARE TERRIBLE
20/05/23, 17:19 - User B  :Thanks, I love salad.
20/05/23, 17:32 - User C :Haha. Dried fruit is partially how I got fat again.
20/05/23, 17:35 - User A :I hate that we cant be trusted to self criticize and we have to have Russian news do it. It feels like watching fox.

20/05/23, 18:32 - User C :Remindme! 243 days
20/05/23, 19:34 - User A :Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead üòú
20/05/23, 20:56 - User B  :Good job fatty!
20/05/23, 20:56 - User C :We don't have any options. Having said that I think [NAME] should have started.
20/05/23, 20:57 - User A :Intelligence is to know the difference between MB and Mbps. Wisdom is to not be a cunt about it.
20/05/23, 21:15 - User B  :Headstand, not handstand. Gotta keep that spine in line.
21/05/23, 12:07 - User C :Post the shaved [NAME] bro! #1 guard all over!
21/05/23, 12:12 - User A :Just go to Morrisville Walmart .. why do you need a meetup.. :) jokes apart . I am willing to join

21/05/23, 12:49 - User A :Oh no, [NAME] is in pain
21/05/23, 12:50 - User B  :I feel bad for all those kids whose parents decided to homeschool them so they could be professional HOTS players without all that stupid learning getting in the way.
21/05/23, 12:51 - User C :For the record I don‚Äôt necessarily want him either. I just think he‚Äôs a compelling person.
21/05/23, 12:56 - User A :Really worried about NISA translating it, but at this point I don't care any more, as long as we get an english version of it.
21/05/23, 12:56 - User B  :Just ask if she wants to go out sometime. It doesn‚Äôt require this much thought
21/05/23, 13:46 - User C :At least he's finally done one thing right. Utter fucking disappointment at every level, by every metric.
21/05/23, 13:48 - User A :Nah, girl, you did great. I'm also shocked by guys who want to hook up without a condom.
21/05/23, 13:48 - User B  :Ah lol just run then
22/05/23, 11:13 - User C :It appeared that she smacked her grape pretty damn good. Oh, and I chuckled. 
22/05/23, 13:17 - User A :It may be wrong, but it‚Äôs not far from the truth. 
22/05/23, 13:17 - User B  :Yep, she's completely isolated. Part of the abuse.
22/05/23, 13:26 - User C :You didnt!
22/05/23, 13:30 - User A :Bags are packed. Have to leave the country at a minimum as it's one of those gyms that's all over the place. Bad times.
22/05/23, 13:30 - User B  :Stop having kids you can't afford. Make sure you check the kids credit to make sure there are no accounts opened in their name. Good luck!
22/05/23, 13:35 - User C :Anyone else think [NAME] talks too much in this and drowns destiny and hbomb out My man be talkin
22/05/23, 13:35 - User A :If this gets put in a video, hi mom!
22/05/23, 13:35 - User B  :Fun fact. If you combined North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana into one state it would have roughly the same population as Puerto Rico!
22/05/23, 13:36 - User C :Wait, you don't love reading people's blog posts on Reddit?
22/05/23, 13:36 - User A :Well thats a rare opinion of Earth X.
22/05/23, 13:36 - User B  :That's awesome. For the record, I do get anxious over very non intrusive questions, I really have a tenancy to read too much into things. 
22/05/23, 13:42 - User C :Man, never underestimate the power of a crock pot, some frozen chicken, veggies and cottage cheese.
22/05/23, 13:44 - User A :I‚Äôm so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you
22/05/23, 13:56 - User B  :did a fanspeak mock, wow I wish this would go down for us
22/05/23, 13:56 - User C :They did that already
22/05/23, 14:03 - User A :American children raised by English parents can easily end up with accents resembling their parents‚Äô.
22/05/23, 14:04 - User B  :6lbs is a lap dog, if someone shoots that cause they're scared it's aggressive...
22/05/23, 14:05 - User C :Your harshest critic will always be yourself
22/05/23, 14:06 - User A :[NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
22/05/23, 14:06 - User B  :At some point, we all hate it. Hey it feels good to be real sometimes. 
22/05/23, 14:06 - User C :Yeah, I'll admit I like Kuzma. [NAME] does kind of remind me of a less talented [NAME].
22/05/23, 14:48 - User A :Yeah I'm not arguing there isnt recreational potential though it can certainly mess you up. Doesn't help most products with dxm have other active ingredients.
22/05/23, 14:50 - User B  :It probably will if you roll your eyes so hard.
22/05/23, 14:51 - User C :[NAME] has continued to show how selfish she is throughout the years..we shouldn't be surprised at this. [NAME] forbid she be the bigger person for the kids.
22/05/23, 14:52 - User A :Hi ex-methodist from another one!
22/05/23, 14:52 - User B  :You are disgusting.
22/05/23, 15:02 - User C :It‚Äôs such a horrible argument I‚Äôm shocked they still use it.
22/05/23, 15:03 - User A :You are waking up to the conditioning It's only a matter of time now
22/05/23, 15:03 - User B  :My girl has slowly been getting more and more into different [NAME] music, but she will always make it a point to play this track. I love it
22/05/23, 15:24 - User C :LOL how he not amused?! They dont like the truth haha
22/05/23, 22:35 - User A :Another strange signing. [NAME] seems great at spotting backup players. 20 odd signings and probably 4 have been decent?
23/05/23, 06:50 - User B  :Tech hobbyist scifi fan (me): That fridge is going to get hacked
23/05/23, 08:39 - User C :I recommend this. I read the WN and it fucked up my English for months. English is my second language...
23/05/23, 08:54 - User A :$13,99 in Canada. It's reaching a price where I may also do a few months at a time and then cancel for a few months.
23/05/23, 09:02 - User B  :> take already pretty average ingredients and add more stuff that actually makes the sandwich worse like Primanti's. Hahaha this is a great way to describe Primantis.
23/05/23, 09:13 - User C :You can't choose what genes you pass on.
23/05/23, 10:23 - User A :Enjoy it! You have a good one for your first!
23/05/23, 10:29 - User B  :Lol for real tho. But hey, we‚Äôre a football, soccer, and tennis school now
23/05/23, 12:55 - User C :Keep asking. Mine turned around eventually.
23/05/23, 12:56 - User A :Sure I understand that. But some of them are are yellow. But when combined with other red flags it definitely confirms your suspicions üòâ
23/05/23, 12:56 - User B  :Looks like something you would see in a comedy movie.
23/05/23, 12:57 - User C :I think she said he hit her through the car window
23/05/23, 12:57 - User A :evolve groove spines, or ask [NAME]
23/05/23, 12:58 - User B  :I'm sorry your trust has been that badly broken.
23/05/23, 12:59 - User C :Same. You all tried to save me, but I rewatched with the sound on and... I have regrets.
23/05/23, 13:00 - User A :Does anybody else see strong parallels between power and freedom? Feel free to distinguish or correlate the two in a comment.
23/05/23, 13:01 - User B  :[NAME] Need people to play with so thanks :)
23/05/23, 13:02 - User C :And they won‚Äòt until it hits them - or not even then, somehow blaming it on others too.
23/05/23, 13:04 - User A :This video was uploaded in October 2013, over five years ago now. This just feels like an unnecessarily inflammatory post for karma to me.
23/05/23, 13:04 - User B  :I know, right?! I was literally in tears Saturday night üò™ It's only 3 years old!!
23/05/23, 13:05 - User C :Legally, you are responsible for damage or harm done as a cop is trying to apprehend you. You caused the dangerous situation by running.
23/05/23, 13:10 - User A :Thanks so much for sharing! I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts and helping me feel less alone. I too hope that it gets better for you!
23/05/23, 13:10 - User B  :These are so handy for quick reference to when they play, thanks for posting!
23/05/23, 13:11 - User C :Never thought I'd see the day lethbridge got onto SRD!
23/05/23, 13:12 - User A :Yikes. Be careful out there.
23/05/23, 13:19 - User B  :Yeah, at least carry a ziploc bag of dead cockroaches with you for this purpose, like a self respecting meal scamming scumbag. 
23/05/23, 13:24 - User C :She's reading Canada's extradition act but not Canada's extradition treaty with the USA. I've had this argument before, it's pointless.
23/05/23, 13:24 - User A :They get a bottle or i get a bottle...may as well share the wealth
23/05/23, 13:25 - User B  :I like how nobody else is doing anything to stop him
23/05/23, 13:43 - User C :Cat noise was added in apparently. Still great video.
23/05/23, 15:12 - User A :It actually makes me really happy when people literally call me [NAME]. Thanks kind stranger!
23/05/23, 15:14 - User B  :every time it gets a little wet and windy
23/05/23, 16:19 - User C :700 euros per week for 16 hour days 6 -7 days a week is shite and well below minimum wage if you work it out per hour.
23/05/23, 16:47 - User A :*scoff* maybe you can‚Äôt. /s
25/05/23, 16:31 - User B  :Has someone mentioned ghost chips yet? If not, then here they are, because we learnt an important lesson then...
25/05/23, 16:34 - User C :Don't kink shame
25/05/23, 17:29 - User A :I took him at the start of the season when he was recording some assists, stopped playing after a while :p
25/05/23, 17:31 - User B  :TIL being a victim of racism validates being a criminal.
25/05/23, 17:34 - User C :That is the plan!
25/05/23, 17:35 - User A :Unfortunately for you, no one of importance cares about your absurd views. 
25/05/23, 17:51 - User B  :None. If you get anything at all, it's a bonus, but don't expect anything.
25/05/23, 17:51 - User C :> it will not make her look like an idiot It would be hard to make her look any more like an idiot than she already does.
25/05/23, 18:29 - User A :Benzos stop working after a few weeks because they‚Äôre very addictive and tolerance grows quickly. I use them occasionally but never more than twice a week.
25/05/23, 19:24 - User B  :Don't chase after out of position teammates. Your life as a Mercy is more important. Let them fools die and learn their lesson.
25/05/23, 21:00 - User C :This made me snort while laughing. Well done!
25/05/23, 21:06 - User A :Aww that's so cute! What a good workmate
25/05/23, 21:53 - User B  :[NAME] doesn't want to leave St Louis, his family is there and won't move away.
25/05/23, 21:58 - User C :Last update was a bit glitchy.
25/05/23, 23:27 - User A :This was definitely worth the $1000+ it cost to do
25/05/23, 23:27 - User B  :Oh awesome! I didn't even notice your name until now lol
26/05/23, 00:00 - User C :You're in the wrong subs
26/05/23, 13:02 - User A :Personally though I like to think of myself as a normy or a snowflake just without negative correlation. C;
26/05/23, 13:15 - User B  :That would actually be awesome.
26/05/23, 14:00 - User C :I think I could watch an entire show with just these two all the time.
26/05/23, 14:06 - User A :I sure do.
02/06/23, 18:54 - User B  :You'll find a few down South, too. No surprise.
02/06/23, 18:55 - User C :The thing is the American hierarchs were ready to act until the Pope stepped in and told them to wait.
02/06/23, 22:16 - User A :That's that frequency dying in your ears. Enjoy it, because you will never hear that exact frequency again
02/06/23, 22:16 - User B  :This is my gift This is my curse
06/06/23, 11:01 - User C :I think the fan base is mostly past that at this point. Almost everyone has MASSIVE problems with some of the decisions Nintendo makes.
06/06/23, 12:08 - User A :I‚Äôm kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
06/06/23, 12:13 - User B  :No I wish. They don't come to Texas very often.
06/06/23, 12:15 - User C :Yep i always say this. Absolutely best case scenario is a foul ball. If he puts it in play it's probably a dribbler.
06/06/23, 12:16 - User A :Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too.
06/06/23, 14:37 - User B  :He overachieved my expectations this year. I hope he tops this years performance next year. Go Gmen!
06/06/23, 14:39 - User C :You are terrible developers.
06/06/23, 14:46 - User A :I just realized people in apartments are essentially screwed, that is too bad man, hopefully you'll get that going soon! It's worth it!
06/06/23, 14:47 - User B  :Will quickly be removed from lobby screen but the game mode selection button will keep the annoying warning/advert.
06/06/23, 15:23 - User C :[NAME] saying [NAME] is already the best shooter on the team got my hyped too
06/06/23, 15:32 - User A :This is what happens when you don‚Äôt beat up the nerd enough
06/06/23, 15:38 - User B  :This. This is too realistic man. Too late for this too.
06/06/23, 15:43 - User C :Thanks so much! I'll let you know how it goes when I get a chance to try it :)
06/06/23, 15:48 - User A :I just ordered a hoodie! Thanks!
06/06/23, 15:49 - User B  :They call it the hub and spoke system. They neglected to include a wheel.
06/06/23, 15:51 - User C :that's awesome-sometimes getting in the shower seems like an impossible undertaking but you did it
06/06/23, 15:51 - User A :Nice, I saw them during the Demo and was pretty impressed 
06/06/23, 15:53 - User B  :What? That is the most recent big meme, it's not cringy
06/06/23, 15:57 - User C :You still didn‚Äôt answer the question. Sorry it‚Äôs bugging me :)
06/06/23, 16:02 - User A :Wait.... What??!
06/06/23, 16:03 - User B  :Yep...this sub blasted me for hating the casey hire and still refuses to admit his big faults
06/06/23, 16:14 - User C :It‚Äôs just speculation, but...yikes!
06/06/23, 16:47 - User A :Educate yourself instead of defining yourself.
06/06/23, 19:41 - User B  :Good luck!
06/06/23, 20:33 - User C :Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
06/06/23, 20:37 - User A :The [NAME] finger wag was sexy as hell.
06/06/23, 20:38 - User B  :Yeah, maybe if they add [NAME] and [NAME]...
06/06/23, 20:39 - User C :[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.
06/06/23, 20:39 - User A :Send it!
07/06/23, 10:59 - User B  :I have a sudden urge to delete my reddit account
07/06/23, 16:35 - User C :[NAME] is such an iconic runway model ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

07/06/23, 20:52 - User A :Tell me a couple
08/06/23, 06:14 - User B  :Walmart is also a good place to look at the local fauna.
08/06/23, 06:18 - User C :Dang.. I‚Äôm none of them. :-(
08/06/23, 06:42 - User A :Hmmm.. This map]( a lot like this map
08/06/23, 06:48 - User B  :Wow thank you so much for the info. I tried looking it up but couldn't find anything. Very interesting stuff
08/06/23, 16:36 - User C :I still get goosebumps every time i hear this track. It's just beautiful .
10/06/23, 09:59 - User A :This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!
12/06/23, 21:58 - User B  :I dont even know what that is lmao
12/06/23, 21:58 - User C :[NAME] is a nut; he has a rubber butt!
12/06/23, 21:59 - User A :The dad is a douche and the cashier seems like he just doesnt have social skills. I really dislike the dad more than anybody.
12/06/23, 22:03 - User B  :They lived a good life! I honor them by using all their parts
15/06/23, 16:44 - User C :Wonder how he feels about [NAME] now
15/06/23, 20:07 - User A :Is there a customer service number? If so, what is it?
19/06/23, 15:05 - User B  :and of course if that happens then there's no way it could be true. as if a protester could also be a paedophile.........
19/06/23, 15:06 - User C :I THOUGHT I HAD MY WILL ALREADY COPIED AND FORGOT I HAD THIS IN MY CLIPBOARD
19/06/23, 15:06 - User A :Yes because there is an optimal level that does not occur naturally.
19/06/23, 15:06 - User B  :Yikes, maybe [NAME] can pull some [NAME] magic with him 
19/06/23, 15:07 - User C :I'm a dudes, he's a dudes, she's a dudes, we're all dudes!
19/06/23, 15:07 - User A :I can‚Äôt believe sb found this even remotely funny.
19/06/23, 15:07 - User B  :I mean going on a dating show when you have a girlfriend though
19/06/23, 15:07 - User C :That would be crazy premature. But would be awesome later when results are out and the stories behind the scenes of the [NAME] team emerges.
19/06/23, 15:07 - User A :Looks like ketchup. üòÆ
19/06/23, 15:07 - User B  :Oi us cancers don‚Äôt want him either! We respectfully pass his birthday to April
19/06/23, 15:07 - User C :Thanks I'll take all the good vibes I can. I'm going to try to sleep too. And get through the next week
19/06/23, 15:08 - User A :Yes she does! She is beautiful but has taken it much too far with the lip fillers and fake tan
19/06/23, 15:08 - User B  :Not sure if we can call him ginger anymore. That hairline went into a recession that'd put 2009 to shame.
19/06/23, 15:13 - User C :Do your research = listen to anecdotal evidence from users(totally reliable!) and try it out, just be comfy!
19/06/23, 15:16 - User A :Very legal and cool
19/06/23, 15:18 - User B  :This thread was actually inspired by one of your comments
19/06/23, 15:20 - User C :If you‚Äôll check my medical records you‚Äôll see I have a crippling arthritis in me index fingers
19/06/23, 15:21 - User A :‚ÄúYou fight like my sister!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought your sister! That‚Äôs a compliment!‚Äù

23/06/23, 13:14 - User B  :Was she? Oh, never been good at picking up on stuff like that. Thanks for letting me know!
23/06/23, 13:14 - User C :I moved to the construction industry because it's less mental stress and I can myself better
28/06/23, 13:24 - User A :who doesn‚Äôt know what an Ethernet port looks like lmao
28/06/23, 13:26 - User B  :Okay, so the wording didn't matter because she was already too into you. Still nice, thanks. 
28/06/23, 13:51 - User C :Same, ASMR is nightmarish. My skin crawls just thinking about it.
28/06/23, 13:52 - User A :That‚Äôs kind of the point of comment sections.
28/06/23, 13:53 - User B  :It looks like someone else was deleted for answering, so I'm hesitant to now. 
28/06/23, 13:54 - User C :Yep. If we don't come up with a solution, there is no need for solutions to anything else.
28/06/23, 13:56 - User A :Totally irrelevant to my point
28/06/23, 14:23 - User B  :Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?
28/06/23, 14:24 - User C :Can't lose if you never stop appealing. Or at least that's what I'm told by your cohorts.
28/06/23, 14:24 - User A :Wiggins and towns pick and roll use it more
28/06/23, 14:25 - User B  :Are you willing to donate to local organizations or do you want to focus on national? What issues do you want addressed?
28/06/23, 14:30 - User C :The fake news media and it's supporters are the enemy of the people.
28/06/23, 14:37 - User A :This is not polyamory. That's just a buddy. It sounds like he's completely taken it off the table.....
28/06/23, 14:38 - User B  :Yard goats was awesome. Almost a major league feel to it when it‚Äôs a packed day
28/06/23, 14:50 - User C :Lol. Thanks for the info
28/06/23, 14:52 - User A :I am a ethnic [NAME] and demand that normies get out! REEEEEE
28/06/23, 14:53 - User B  :I thought we traded away our losers like [NAME] and [NAME] already.
28/06/23, 14:53 - User C :Ow is correct.
28/06/23, 14:54 - User A :Let's not forget that local politicians don't like it and give them hell for their efforts.
28/06/23, 14:56 - User B  :Just a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy
28/06/23, 14:57 - User C :Lol dont mess with [NAME]!
28/06/23, 15:02 - User A :Something tells me she just got it too.
28/06/23, 15:16 - User B  :Yeah, because it‚Äôs soooo arduous to look at someone‚Äôs profile for five seconds. 
28/06/23, 15:17 - User C :It's more laid back, which I kinda love.
28/06/23, 15:29 - User A :My point was they had no choice but to pull social levers to try and improve health, as they didn't have anything else at their disposal. 
28/06/23, 15:42 - User B  :> why have all of my responses been restating my opinion Because you're cruising on righteous indignation rather than empirical evidence. Facts don't care about your feelings.
28/06/23, 15:43 - User C :Just hold on a second...Curley: "Oh, ok, no problem"
28/06/23, 15:47 - User A :Dozens. My favorite scene is the tribe bringing dude back from the dead. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA. CHIIIIIKA.
28/06/23, 16:06 - User B  :Perhaps not a mainline souls game, but you can't deny the similarities to Soulsborne games. It's basically an iteration on the formula. 
28/06/23, 16:38 - User C :I like this idea.
28/06/23, 16:53 - User A :He a cute sneck
28/06/23, 16:54 - User B  :Can you please write up a summary of how the event went? The live stream isn't working because they changed the venue. Thank you!
28/06/23, 16:56 - User C :She‚Äôs like a younger freshener looking [NAME] though lol
28/06/23, 16:56 - User A :I wish I had a name
28/06/23, 16:56 - User B  :As comic book guy from Simpson‚Äôs would say. WORST. WRITTEN CRIMELORD. EVER....
28/06/23, 17:00 - User C :No. You're not the only one.
28/06/23, 17:02 - User A :Ah. Ok. I get it. Have an upvote.
28/06/23, 18:38 - User B  :How do they know how tall you are while your sitting in your car. Such bullshit.
02/07/23, 21:22 - User C :Get back on your meds mate..You aren't funny at all...
03/07/23, 12:13 - User A :Just googled him. Only thing is how do I get in contact with him.
03/07/23, 12:31 - User B  :Thank you for the great recommendation. I'll get on that as soon as I can, and keep you updated.

03/07/23, 12:41 - User B  :i think people are just getting more and more fed up with playing against him
03/07/23, 12:41 - User C :Worst in the country by far.
03/07/23, 13:05 - User A :Folks are complaining about the new buses.
03/07/23, 22:06 - User B  :It's got what plants crave.
04/07/23, 11:16 - User C :But it looks so fluffy
04/07/23, 11:17 - User A :I **LOVE** that the players are finally getting into the game. People feel invested! I like that!
04/07/23, 11:37 - User B  :Wow, that's clunky.
04/07/23, 11:37 - User C :It's always been a dodgy road, proposals were put in ages ago
04/07/23, 15:24 - User A :Really curious to know how you know what people are going to think in 500 years, you ass.
04/07/23, 15:24 - User B  :I love when these self-proclaimed ones would hound me for more pics.
04/07/23, 15:24 - User C :how blurry this photo is r/mildlyinfuriating
04/07/23, 15:26 - User A :my parents did this for 8 years. apparently it‚Äôs a lot of fun

05/07/23, 11:06 - User B  :Do not use logic dude. Not cool.
05/07/23, 11:10 - User C :Not all seatbelts prevent you from hitting. source: shattered my kneecap and fucked up my legs on the dash of my Miata
05/07/23, 11:24 - User A :I was in that phase for a good while until i lost it all later anyways.
05/07/23, 11:31 - User B  :Just wanted to say that I'm also a 29 year old male and I'm in the exact same situation as you.
05/07/23, 11:31 - User C :Bless your heart. Mine hit me at Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm so sorry.
05/07/23, 11:31 - User A :Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
05/07/23, 11:34 - User B  :Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.
05/07/23, 11:34 - User C :I was totally expecting this
05/07/23, 11:34 - User A :No a white chubby boy with scene hair. He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt in the video.
05/07/23, 11:38 - User B  :Lol thanks for understanding that it's humor as a coping mechanism...there are some comments on here that don't seem to grasp the concept very well.
05/07/23, 11:39 - User C :FOR THE LOVE OF [NAME] WATCH THE DUB. THANK ME LATER. You can watch it on Crunchyroll, Hulu, or Kissanime/Dubhappy clones.
05/07/23, 11:39 - User A :Im so sad how that movie turned out. We could have achived something good
05/07/23, 11:47 - User B  :Wait. That‚Äôs illegal.
05/07/23, 11:47 - User C :Hard Candy. You're welcome.
05/07/23, 11:48 - User A :For I second I thought he was a sophomore learning to drive based on that figure, baby face from a distance and choice of clothing
05/07/23, 11:48 - User B  :This is full of bullshit
05/07/23, 11:48 - User C :But you might not be special for them. You can't make someone love you.
05/07/23, 11:55 - User A :AMN is absolutely good enough and [NAME] is also very highly rated
05/07/23, 12:07 - User B  :Hallmark movies are the worst culprits.

05/07/23, 12:45 - User C :Anti-vaxers aren't funny anymore, now they're just scary...
05/07/23, 12:56 - User A :[NAME] was so much cuter then. Also WOW that interview is cringy
05/07/23, 12:57 - User B  :This is disgusting.... please make more.
05/07/23, 12:57 - User C :I know he comes with a lot of baggage but i‚Äôd probably go with [NAME]. Just look what he did for [NAME].
05/07/23, 12:57 - User A :if your favorite subreddit is the correct spelling of Zack then you‚Äôll LOVE r/zach
05/07/23, 12:57 - User B  :Ugh. I just hate seeing this name :(
05/07/23, 13:00 - User C :Anyone know the [NAME] choke move from Mortal Kombat X? My dude here just demonstrated it perfectly in real life.

05/07/23, 15:25 - User A :That isn‚Äôt the Thai flag? üáπüá≠
05/07/23, 15:39 - User B  :Some idiot talks shit to one woman - > SOCIETY shames WOMEN for BEING ALIVE
05/07/23, 15:40 - User C :YES CIZ so glad I saw this here, really well done, there is no end to your creativity.
05/07/23, 17:43 - User A :Yeah. Whose fault is that... maybe the terroristic Gazan government stealing all their money. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a safe bet.
05/07/23, 17:43 - User B  :You should have gone and joined her for a drink.... That‚Äôs my dream... Eventually sit down and enjoy a drink with my siblings.
05/07/23, 20:48 - User C :How do you walk about eating pasta?!
05/07/23, 20:48 - User A :We'd never lose again with him giving the crazy eyes to anybody who makes a mistake.
05/07/23, 23:32 - User B  :Someone with erectile dysfunction already can't (conventionally) orgasm. What the fuck are you talking about?
06/07/23, 00:28 - User C :I love [NAME] and how openly she is in supporting him to run
06/07/23, 09:11 - User A :same- just about to recommend this book. it's a fantastic review of rheum disease states, diagnoses, treatments, etc.
06/07/23, 09:11 - User B  :I'm climbing the walls right now. Just let me out of the house.

06/07/23, 10:38 - User C :You're welcome
07/07/23, 14:47 - User A :Probably [NAME] tbh. I feel like what [NAME] did in the long run was a bit scummier, not by much tho.
09/07/23, 12:12 - User B  :What an amazing comment!This really resonates with me! Thanks for writing.
09/07/23, 12:13 - User C :Can you read? It says right there the tweeter‚Äôs husband got out to help the woman and ask if she was okay
09/07/23, 13:55 - User A :Wait theres rats!!!??? Im calling health and safty!
09/07/23, 19:44 - User B  :I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted but it‚Äôs 4 years
10/07/23, 07:56 - User C :I think there was a reason, there was for me. I saw her as far too power-hungry and completely full of herself.
10/07/23, 09:17 - User A :How delightful it is that it truly could apply to multiple moms
10/07/23, 09:17 - User B  :You're saying it's depressing to see someone eating whilst other people are starving.
10/07/23, 09:17 - User C :lol You could have saved even more time by not making a douche comment
10/07/23, 09:56 - User A :Awesome, love the input! I totally get what you‚Äôre saying!
10/07/23, 09:56 - User B  :What a grim statistic for Canada.

10/07/23, 14:28 - User B  :So is [NAME] the frontrunner for Executive of the Year, pre trade deadline?
10/07/23, 14:29 - User C :"I'm a lady! I do ladies things!" He's a real life [NAME]!
10/07/23, 20:22 - User A :Hard to get motivated to play when the fans are burying one of your teammates.
10/07/23, 21:08 - User B  :That means nothing beyond the fact that I couldn‚Äôt be asked arguing with you. It was a no contest essentially.
10/07/23, 21:09 - User C :Gotta pay sincere condiments for this rant... if I mustard the strength I'll ketchup to the topic.
10/07/23, 21:53 - User A :I'm a [NAME] and tripping has only strengthened my faith. To each their own.

11/07/23, 10:17 - User C :Hey thanks! Happy new year to you too!
11/07/23, 10:17 - User A :SKAM was great. I literally binged all of S3 as soon as I got home last night.
11/07/23, 10:17 - User B  :This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.
11/07/23, 10:17 - User C :Vapenorth.ca is a great place to order the Dyna from.
11/07/23, 10:18 - User A :OK. You‚Äôre not distinguishing yourself from an anti-theist. >[RELIGION] [NAME] I said ‚Äòa god‚Äô.
11/07/23, 10:18 - User B  :I thought I was the only person who enjoyed the dlc. I finished it so satisfied with how it went then looked online...was blown away by the reception.
11/07/23, 10:22 - User C :Yo where they at, I want to celebrate with them.
11/07/23, 10:37 - User A :Have you talked to your group and [NAME] about him?
11/07/23, 10:38 - User B  :Trust me man. Don't see it. It's scarring.
11/07/23, 12:16 - User C :I support abortion
11/07/23, 12:51 - User A :Not at all. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't understand what a strawman is.
11/07/23, 13:10 - User B  :Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. 
11/07/23, 13:10 - User C :You're right, it's relatable. Hope everything's OK for you 
11/07/23, 13:10 - User A :Why would you mention [NAME]? Lol
11/07/23, 13:34 - User B  :They didn't "say" anything this time either. This is where observation and critical thinking comes in. I trust you can figure it out.
11/07/23, 13:34 - User C :Softest fans in sports
11/07/23, 13:36 - User A :Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh
11/07/23, 15:39 - User B  :Feeling your pain. I was laid off due to our department closing the week after Thanksgiving. Good luck to you. Stay strong.
11/07/23, 19:58 - User C :I met him! He graduated from my high school and came back when I was a freshman to talk to us in PE. Really nice guy.
11/07/23, 20:16 - User A :oh cool! Must be tiring for [NAME] though. Looking forward to watching them!
11/07/23, 20:20 - User B  :Thought so. Thanks!

11/07/23, 20:35 - User A :They are high pressure hoses, think about getting waterboarded.
11/07/23, 20:35 - User B  :That‚Äôd what you think.
11/07/23, 20:38 - User C :These videos are legendary
11/07/23, 20:39 - User A :[NAME] fucking practice and watch some tutorials before fucking up a $100 bottle of French champagne

11/07/23, 20:46 - User C :Same here. There's so much good to discover in any decade really.
11/07/23, 20:48 - User A :Well, when you look back in the history many hypes say a lot about humanity in general. That doesn't mean every person enjoyed the thing.
11/07/23, 21:24 - User B  :Your posts cause cancer.
13/07/23, 10:29 - User C :Glad someone brought that up.
13/07/23, 10:31 - User A :Yeah I reckon. I inspected the property too, just forgot to check/ask until after. I'll pass out of principal haha
13/07/23, 10:49 - User B  :You sir have put into words my exact feelings on this matter.

13/07/23, 12:03 - User A :i‚Äôn on a diet for my disease AND to lose weight therefore it cancels out boys, i‚Äôm scot free
13/07/23, 12:36 - User B  :I binged that podcast in about 2 days at work. Amazing. The convention for Limelight, and how emotional they got for those poor women was heartbreaking.
13/07/23, 13:51 - User C :Looks like a bookshelf to me
13/07/23, 13:51 - User A :oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.

13/07/23, 20:24 - User B  :I tend to invalidate my feelings because I‚Äôm always worried that they‚Äôre going to think that being silly, I‚Äôm always struggling with it
13/07/23, 20:25 - User C :Probably wouldn't hurt to delete this post and pretend it never was posted.
13/07/23, 21:47 - User A :*cries in south america*
13/07/23, 22:25 - User B  :There was definitely 90s-drama-film-esque piano music playing when this unfolded.
13/07/23, 22:25 - User C :Even if no sickness is spread, no one else wants to see or smell that while they are eating. 
13/07/23, 22:25 - User A :The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. 
13/07/23, 22:25 - User B  :Naw, you're good. They had something else and lost it. Don't feel bad
13/07/23, 22:25 - User C :Turns out they weren't wrong about [NAME] either

13/07/23, 22:30 - User B  :Those are sexist theories not facts.
13/07/23, 22:45 - User C :This too. It‚Äôs about how much excess the wealthy have, not how they acquired it.
13/07/23, 22:47 - User A :Knowing [NAME] he‚Äôd probably give [NAME] up for a 5th rounder smh
13/07/23, 22:51 - User B  :What ribs lmao
13/07/23, 23:40 - User C :Are you actually making all this?
14/07/23, 00:07 - User A :Well. That went sideways pretty quickly.
14/07/23, 08:25 - User B  :That‚Äôs so incredibly rude and inaccurate. You can‚Äôt actually believe that.
14/07/23, 08:26 - User C :Great, glad to hear most socialists are hypocrites who ascribe supernatural outcomes to their ideology
14/07/23, 08:30 - User A :I definitely saw a tweet where someone threw their razor in their toilet. They‚Äôre gonna have to fish it out sometime...
14/07/23, 08:35 - User B  :Like a low budget version of this amazing game show

14/07/23, 13:38 - User B  :It's not *literally* the same investigation.

15/07/23, 11:04 - User A :oh you.
15/07/23, 11:05 - User B  :Yeah, sadly, looks like this champ will be pretty opressive. 
15/07/23, 11:09 - User C :I'm expressing my distaste at the absurdity of being an internet outrage hero and hypocritical selective outrage, especially in an area such as black music.
15/07/23, 11:10 - User A :totally agree.
15/07/23, 11:18 - User B  :I agree that you need more time in the later turns. But most games it feels like people wait until it is their turn to start thinking.
15/07/23, 11:21 - User C :Haha yes! Ill do that to my cat all the time. He seeems to appreciate the assist
15/07/23, 11:24 - User A :Well what would make us special? He's vouching for his friend.

15/07/23, 13:46 - User A :Why do you feel like you have to figure out what life is alone?
15/07/23, 13:47 - User B  :I agree. This is assault. Leave the ignorant hill [NAME] alone.
15/07/23, 13:47 - User C :Dammit. I was expecting to see a motorcycle blow up. That woulda been awesome. Haha
15/07/23, 13:47 - User A :I was wondering if that would be spotted. It is from the movie Split. saw the image on Reddit and immediately thought of lions.
15/07/23, 13:49 - User B  :We should build a pipeline! Oh wait...
15/07/23, 13:49 - User C :Then tell me what he's doing, instead of being a racist hypocrite.
15/07/23, 13:50 - User A :#On a rainy day I dont accept any doordash requests unless there is a minimum of $5 bonus
15/07/23, 13:50 - User B  :Kinda both, they maintain a pin-up section in their newspaper bizarrely enough. Not like any of the credible newspapers in the province ever needed that.
15/07/23, 13:51 - User C :fyi, straight men also use dildos. Also, your mom is awesome!
15/07/23, 13:51 - User A :Put the dip in your butthole. Better buzz and no risk of losing your jaw
15/07/23, 13:51 - User B  :It does look good!
15/07/23, 13:54 - User C :Tried so hard and got so far, in the end it doesnt even matter
15/07/23, 14:12 - User A :While that is cute-try to do critical thinking while u are reading. Prove your god exsists-let him smite me. That mighty smiter.
15/07/23, 15:48 - User B  :Has to be [NAME] doesn't it? 3 [NAME] in the squad with another on trial, plus they're pretty shit this season.
15/07/23, 18:19 - User C :You'll be fine.
16/07/23, 10:34 - User A :Hes looking for a handout of 3 free meals a day, education and skill training and a roof over his head. Jail, it works.
16/07/23, 13:36 - User B  :is a minimum score. If you don't get it you fail the ASVAB. It's a really simple concept.
16/07/23, 19:36 - User C :Because they're having to compete and so we get exposed to the weakest of the bunch.
16/07/23, 19:38 - User A :Oh interesting username
16/07/23, 19:38 - User B  :Oh this one is making the rounds again? The new cohort of [NAME] must have arrived
16/07/23, 19:48 - User C :I mean, you can't be any more in the friends zone if you have a matching neck tattoo with the chick.
16/07/23, 19:49 - User A :What is the $250,000 figure based on?
16/07/23, 19:51 - User B  :This sub absolutely gets personal within seconds of anything he says being postes
16/07/23, 19:52 - User C :That's not cute
16/07/23, 19:54 - User A :Yours is censored though.
16/07/23, 19:56 - User B  :Tour child is a genius, that would be awesome
16/07/23, 20:04 - User C :He took the pin, and verbally put him over. Big night for [NAME].
16/07/23, 22:23 - User A :I feel like you need to get out of your current situation for the sake of your own happiness.
16/07/23, 22:24 - User B  :Everyone knows he's not a spy. He's a pawn. Russia want him to swap for their actual spy, currently talking to [NAME]. 
16/07/23, 22:24 - User C :There's so many! Auntie [NAME] and Dame [NAME] are two of the best. But personally, the bass player from Spiderbait, [NAME].
16/07/23, 22:24 - User A :What? I didn‚Äôt understand a thing of what you said.
16/07/23, 22:25 - User B  :I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude
16/07/23, 22:27 - User C :Love [NAME], he reminds me of the little receiver from NE Edlemen (I think misspelled) .
16/07/23, 22:27 - User A :Yes he is. Cling to your safety blanket for now cause momma [NAME] is about to snatch it from you.
16/07/23, 22:28 - User B  :I know this was coming, so I phrased it as "**my** past relationships" not as my **EX.** Anyhow, thanks Bro
16/07/23, 22:29 - User C :Great quote.
16/07/23, 22:45 - User A :BCH has mostly stopped doing this too. No one who matters fell for it.
16/07/23, 22:45 - User B  :Sorry to hear that brother! Solid advice and power and love to you. Here is knowing things will get better and that you're a champ!
16/07/23, 22:47 - User C :Yeah this is downright spooky; she's not even using that face mask.
16/07/23, 22:48 - User A :That took a turn.
16/07/23, 22:53 - User B  :Welcome to MTV Cribs! The whole place is a giant bed for me
16/07/23, 22:54 - User C :Looks like goodfellow
16/07/23, 23:03 - User A :I have a 17 year old friend who just googles "memes" to get his fix
16/07/23, 23:07 - User B  :Upvoted for visibility. Disapprove of the poll results.
16/07/23, 23:24 - User C :As a lover of PG and Scrubs, I've not seen this one. What a genius tongue in cheek celebration to [NAME], [NAME] and PG.
16/07/23, 23:37 - User A :Just appreciate the moment jeez
16/07/23, 23:51 - User B  :Lmao, your joke did not go unnoticed to me!
17/07/23, 07:50 - User C :I don't find anything about women appealing.
17/07/23, 07:56 - User A :Ya did good, bud.
17/07/23, 08:01 - User B  :Wow, out of all of that, only one person mentioned helping parents because they loved their parents. SAD.
17/07/23, 08:02 - User C :Buncha people having (admittedly loud) fun. Don‚Äôt really see the issue.
17/07/23, 14:02 - User A :They were barely given a chance
17/07/23, 14:02 - User B  :My least favorite couple: [NAME] and [NAME].
17/07/23, 14:03 - User C :Funny how that works! Thanks for digging up the link, I've been on a 90s ska nostalgia trip ever since I clicked it :P
17/07/23, 14:07 - User A :You don't have to watch it if you don't want to. Nobody is holding a gun to your head.
17/07/23, 14:38 - User B  :For liquids I might leave the "7" out and make sure your citizens are the only race that can spawn in highly savage areas.
17/07/23, 14:39 - User C :That guy talked bad about his haircut I guess
17/07/23, 15:55 - User A :Thanks!!
17/07/23, 16:32 - User B  :That‚Äôs better:-) now go get em tiger
17/07/23, 16:33 - User C :Thanks I hate it.
17/07/23, 16:34 - User A :Because she knows shame and he asked.
17/07/23, 16:35 - User B  :What is the chair in the photo? I'm torn between sex toy and torture device.
17/07/23, 16:35 - User C :I miss the confetti cakes :(
17/07/23, 17:11 - User A :I never thought about that. Good point. Cursed and wilted rose, unlike [NAME] rose emblem.
17/07/23, 17:12 - User B  :I love how serious and mad cats get when the dog starts messing around with them all playful
17/07/23, 17:19 - User C :Lol! Thanks. That cap would pop right off in there. Lol. Love it
17/07/23, 17:56 - User A :It was received on Jan 25th at 9:22 am .81627 BTC and $3800. for it with a $600. fee. Happy!
18/07/23, 10:23 - User B  :Didn‚Äôt know he had his initials on his thigh pads too
18/07/23, 10:23 - User C :Is that her phone in her back pocket?
18/07/23, 10:23 - User A :This guy looks like the real life [NAME]
18/07/23, 10:24 - User B  :I read the title, and honestly I thought it was [NAME] and his Telkom bill again
18/07/23, 10:32 - User C :Interesting, thanks for the article, guess they're just as bad!
18/07/23, 10:32 - User A :OMG. Indict this oligarch.
18/07/23, 10:33 - User B  :Just gotta stop overthinking. Try meditation. That helps control your thoughts better.
18/07/23, 10:35 - User C :And now I'm hungry. Thanks.
18/07/23, 10:42 - User A :You must be new around here.
18/07/23, 10:43 - User B  :Fucking love that song.
18/07/23, 10:44 - User C :It is a kayak
18/07/23, 11:07 - User A :I agree 100%
18/07/23, 11:08 - User B  :Sexy teeth.
18/07/23, 11:13 - User C :Even if this was true who would want to take medication that causes such rapid mood swings
18/07/23, 11:15 - User A :I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm here! Thank you all!
18/07/23, 11:17 - User B  :But "questioning" overwhelming evidence presented with a comprehensive explanation without any sort of counterargument is perhaps better called *denying*.
18/07/23, 11:17 - User C :Naaah, that is and always will be [NAME], especially since her redesign in MKX. perfect waifu.
18/07/23, 11:21 - User A :So can we all collectively accept that [NAME] has a high placement for this week? Okay thank you
18/07/23, 11:24 - User B  :The food you are putting in your mouth is causing obesity. Stop abusing it. A higher body weight is the cause of your increased risk of ILLNESSES
18/07/23, 11:25 - User C :I think I‚Äôll go ahead and continue criticizing silly unfounded and harmful beliefs
18/07/23, 11:27 - User A :What the heck? $3 a month for 30 texts? That's ridiculous.
18/07/23, 11:32 - User B  :i passed thanks everyone
18/07/23, 13:05 - User C :What happened in his personal life? I know he had a bunch of head injuries; is there more than that?
18/07/23, 13:09 - User A :oh, my bad
18/07/23, 17:16 - User B  :Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)
18/07/23, 17:16 - User C :I'm not giving more clicks for a video when the headline should be explained in the body of the Arte.
18/07/23, 17:17 - User A :And he'll still be unimaginably rich after the fact, so this has gone so far into edge-case territory where the unfairness doesn't really matter
18/07/23, 17:17 - User B  :That is odd.
18/07/23, 17:18 - User C :If we didn‚Äôt throw out offers after [NAME] himself has been all over it. Then lynch needs to get checked.
18/07/23, 17:19 - User A :Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised by that either. I'm so excited to see or hear SOMETHING though. 
18/07/23, 17:26 - User B  :It kills me how much Oklahoma State and Iowa State are able to beat KU but [NAME] and [NAME] just couldn‚Äôt regularly get the job done.
18/07/23, 17:27 - User C :Sorry, but anarcho-anything are bot welcome there
18/07/23, 17:58 - User A :the 12 steps of AA are not the only rehab programs in the world.
18/07/23, 18:42 - User B  :You're not going to get anywhere with these kids, mate. Reddit is being astroturfed.
18/07/23, 18:43 - User C :Population control in russia
18/07/23, 18:47 - User A :I think the biggest fucking thing is that apparently reaper has a goddamn family himself.
18/07/23, 18:48 - User B  :Stuck on icy stairs.
18/07/23, 18:48 - User C :Even worse.
18/07/23, 18:48 - User A :It was some other girls
18/07/23, 18:48 - User B  :I've probably put a couple hundred miles on my space saver tire. It's still on there right now.
18/07/23, 18:49 - User C :Not when they are written by his lawyers, but he totally wrote 'build the wall crime will fall' and thought it was so clever
18/07/23, 18:49 - User A :Give me a country and I'll do some research and post what I find in the morning.
18/07/23, 18:50 - User B  :she and [NAME] seem genuinely happy with each other now. i‚Äôm happy for them both
18/07/23, 18:51 - User C :You‚Äôre welcome
18/07/23, 18:52 - User A :What a heartless person lol
18/07/23, 18:52 - User B  :Let's hope January treats us a little better than December.
18/07/23, 18:53 - User C :this is beautiful !!! my poor baby tho, why is she crying ??? ;(( 
18/07/23, 18:53 - User A :Going for that most hated title with stupid posts from his "fans " 
18/07/23, 18:54 - User B  :Ah, that's why they say don't run in the corridor
18/07/23, 18:54 - User C :Thank you very much for your time and advice! I‚Äôll consider it greatly for the future!
18/07/23, 18:55 - User A :You just gotta have little faith. They are gonna need more money and maybe then we can get to Tahiti.
18/07/23, 18:56 - User B  :I'll probably try this one day üòÖ
18/07/23, 18:56 - User C :Ironically, I just sense that they are working in an area where this is a ready stream of revenue just waiting for them.
18/07/23, 18:56 - User A :It‚Äôs all a show. Welcome to season one of tanking in the Windy City.
18/07/23, 18:56 - User B  :HAHAHAHA YELLOW FOR AZPI????
18/07/23, 18:58 - User C :Become friends with people who work night shift. We are always up at crazy hours and need a distraction from our work.
18/07/23, 19:04 - User A :At the time it was a steal, and all the players we traded have basically been worst case scenario for the A's.
18/07/23, 19:04 - User B  :And now what you've been waiting for, another long raga by [NAME].
18/07/23, 19:06 - User C :Ah yes, resort to ad-hominem attacks when you have nothing else to say.
18/07/23, 19:53 - User A :Maybe it‚Äôs flaccid and shaking it makes sense when you‚Äôre being put under in the comments. loool read a few pounds.
19/07/23, 08:36 - User B  :How crazy is that, matrix confirmed.
19/07/23, 08:45 - User C :They're hoping that him being found guilty was the news item that mattered, and they can let him off easy now that the attention has died down.
19/07/23, 11:23 - User A :I'm surprised he survived the primary.
19/07/23, 13:13 - User B  :okay but where to find bara that isnt fetish/sex stuff and is more wholesome and romantic?
19/07/23, 13:16 - User C :I'm down for a [NAME] frenemy alliance along the lines of [NAME]
19/07/23, 14:58 - User A :I'm glad you got the help you needed. Sorry we couldn't help you here.
19/07/23, 18:58 - User B  :Before the camera was on him, he noticed the atrocious fake jersey on the nimrod beside him. 
20/07/23, 09:07 - User C :I like you. No promo
20/07/23, 11:12 - User A :you arent a real 90's kid if you were born after 1999

22/07/23, 07:47 - User C :He didn't blow anything. She blew it with him. What a fun guy!
22/07/23, 21:06 - User A :That sounds like an appropriate response. Thank you for saving me the time.
22/07/23, 21:29 - User B  :If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. 
22/07/23, 21:32 - User C :Okay, diet is important that's true. Do you take any medication? Do you have a psychiatrist or doctor who you see for your mental health?
22/07/23, 21:32 - User A :He is this year. Most likely not over the next three years.
22/07/23, 21:34 - User B  :Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.
22/07/23, 21:35 - User C :It inhales you ignorant octorok
22/07/23, 21:36 - User A :Meth and booze.
23/07/23, 10:33 - User B  :You're a turd
23/07/23, 13:45 - User C :Between POM, Mata and Stockdale for me
23/07/23, 13:47 - User A :We will welcome you with open arms <3
23/07/23, 20:21 - User B  :Pets are the best ‚ù§
23/07/23, 23:18 - User C :Does anyone know how much that would be in (¬£) pounds.
23/07/23, 23:23 - User A :I got banned on an old account for no discernible reason months after I had last posted there.
24/07/23, 00:20 - User B  :Very wholesome!
24/07/23, 02:42 - User C :that was so sad :(
24/07/23, 02:47 - User A :I love the night shift environment, but hate the lifestyle. I just can't do it. 
24/07/23, 02:48 - User B  :I personally wish that they stuck with the spin offs but if their happy I‚Äôm good.üëå
24/07/23, 05:57 - User C :It was never about comparisons, it was about our experiences and relationship to capitalists here.
24/07/23, 06:09 - User A :Yess! Some of my favorite lines from the trilogy. [NAME] killing joke monologue still seems very relevant today.
24/07/23, 06:11 - User B  :I equally love and despise them when they talk about a player diving as "flopping"
24/07/23, 06:43 - User C :I really hope you do this for a living. Thanks!
24/07/23, 06:44 - User A :Mammatus clouds! Somewhat unusual for Sydney
24/07/23, 06:45 - User B  :More Nice Guy IMO.
24/07/23, 06:54 - User C :Nothing wrong with kayo
24/07/23, 06:59 - User A :Canada here, yup..... gods damned homophobic leftovers.
24/07/23, 07:05 - User B  :Cinesphere and Trillium Park are both fantastic spots and I see absolutely zero reason to change them.
24/07/23, 07:30 - User C :Heh, don't know how it was back then but I'd really suggest giving it a spin now - it's like life-consumingly good!
24/07/23, 08:09 - User A :Sending you some Ramona wine as thanks!
24/07/23, 08:09 - User B  :All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting
24/07/23, 08:09 - User C :Sweet sweet air con. Apparently it‚Äôs going to be a hot one today.
24/07/23, 08:09 - User A :Bdo is love
24/07/23, 08:10 - User B  :UNLESS THEY ARE ABUSIVE OR IT'S AN LDR!
24/07/23, 08:10 - User C :Lol, the delusion is strong.
24/07/23, 08:11 - User A :Not even going to open the link. Already know I agree with Sloss.
24/07/23, 08:21 - User B  :what guy or girl would be glad to get this as a gift
24/07/23, 08:23 - User C :Think I'm gonna get a chance radio, so I can talk to other car beds. 
24/07/23, 08:23 - User A :Does it tickle inside your nostril? I always imagined it would be annoying.
24/07/23, 08:30 - User B  :Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
24/07/23, 08:43 - User C :It's weird that many places consider iguanas invasive species..
24/07/23, 08:43 - User A :"I have to deal with this, so now you have to also." 
24/07/23, 08:44 - User B  :I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.
24/07/23, 08:44 - User C :Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out
24/07/23, 08:49 - User A :Thank you!! That‚Äôs me as [NAME]!

24/07/23, 09:08 - User C :My Ping Pong Queen looks so happy! I cried lol

24/07/23, 10:02 - User A :POINTER!!!!!! YOU DA REAL ALL STAR!!!
24/07/23, 10:09 - User B  :Okay, gotcha. Does your wife have a lot of stress and anxiety from her job, or just in general?
24/07/23, 10:10 - User C :Wah Mum other people call me on my bullshit and I can't ban them , Go out side son.
24/07/23, 10:33 - User A :That's probably the price a [NAME] pays to rent the Trump Hotel D.C. Ballroom for a cocktail party. Whoop de fucking doo.
24/07/23, 11:12 - User B  :You are my own side. I feel an affinity for this sub and want to make it a good experience for all.
24/07/23, 11:34 - User C :making us look like punks, disappointing
24/07/23, 11:40 - User A :Im hoping for a relapse too. I like her better, her hair gets darker, her leather jacket comes out. I miss private practice [NAME]
24/07/23, 11:40 - User B  :I would have used "perplexing" haha
24/07/23, 11:41 - User C :I love me some Cat but someone clearly never read The mists of Avalon
24/07/23, 11:41 - User A :Beautiful face, but scenically over the top
24/07/23, 11:42 - User B  :I mean, struggle enough, the ropes will become loose. You'll live, go to the police, and get in some kind of protection.
24/07/23, 11:42 - User C :This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
24/07/23, 17:42 - User A :I never said they were emotionless
24/07/23, 17:47 - User B  :Eh, we all pay for sex one way or another. More power to you.
24/07/23, 17:52 - User C :Srs it's so bizarre! There's often someone like "OP is wayyy prettier than [celebrity]!!!" as well. 
24/07/23, 17:53 - User A :Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, Labyrinth. My holy trinity of movies I both loved and was intimidated by as a child.
24/07/23, 18:04 - User B  :The description of the cut marks that KZ gave in MaM sounds as if a sawz-all was used.
24/07/23, 18:56 - User C :i hope so
24/07/23, 19:00 - User A :I unironically agree with everything on the left side of this.
24/07/23, 19:02 - User B  :Treat yo self!
24/07/23, 19:12 - User C :Trinity: Ru: >THIS IS THE TOP LEVEL DRAG YOURE DOING IT HERE RIGHT NOW
24/07/23, 19:55 - User A :Great work brother!
24/07/23, 19:57 - User B  :Other form of distractions such as shopping, reading, media, being here and also being surrounded by people I find attractive :-/
24/07/23, 20:11 - User C :Well done OP for acting on your words. I hope you have a great day together!
24/07/23, 20:12 - User A :nah.....anime is weird
24/07/23, 20:44 - User B  :When I think about [NAME] and [NAME] at the same time I get a fucking aneurysm from the stupidity.
24/07/23, 20:45 - User C :You don‚Äôt understand the design of our government.
24/07/23, 20:49 - User A :I love the RDS.
24/07/23, 20:51 - User B  :That man had some hilarious lines/events
24/07/23, 22:38 - User C :What an absolute moron. Talking about characters everyone and their inbred mother knew would be back. His stupidity fucked him over.
24/07/23, 22:43 - User A :And ignoring how "magic" works in the same way you support your arguments.
25/07/23, 07:17 - User B  :They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
25/07/23, 07:31 - User C :Umm, but I got to a Barber Shop that has more female barbers than men....
25/07/23, 08:03 - User A :This girl is really hot. tight biker suit and all that.
25/07/23, 08:33 - User B  :Proud of you.
25/07/23, 08:35 - User C :This girl is my hero.
25/07/23, 11:02 - User A :I only watch bad animes sorry
25/07/23, 14:44 - User B  :Some kind of situation(s) you experienced that made you realize that, or someone else's experience...
25/07/23, 14:45 - User C :Don‚Äôt think this was posted yet
25/07/23, 14:53 - User A :You sure? They seem so much brighter on screen lol
25/07/23, 15:09 - User B  :Oh dear, I'm so sorry you are going through this. I don't have any sage advice but I hope things get better for you.
25/07/23, 15:11 - User C :How dumb haha
25/07/23, 15:12 - User A :It will be carefully tailored to piss their parents off, which I will enjoy greatly :-)
25/07/23, 15:22 - User B  :It's absolutely beautiful
25/07/23, 15:23 - User C :[NAME] at 2.38 against Moicano seems like excellent value for me
25/07/23, 15:24 - User A :I‚Äôm in Florence right now on a holiday and my [NAME] does it make me want to replay that game
25/07/23, 15:24 - User B  :You freakin wizard, I love this. 
25/07/23, 15:31 - User C :He‚Äôs such a little bitch, impossible to like
25/07/23, 15:33 - User A :That ET one looks like he has stuck his finger is some strawberry jello or something and is disgusted that some has stuck to his finger!
25/07/23, 15:34 - User B  :Would be a great pick up tbh
25/07/23, 15:34 - User C :I did this first try but then the next time I played I was ducking hollering
25/07/23, 15:47 - User A :Shame.
25/07/23, 16:02 - User B  :Wasnt much to ruin.
25/07/23, 16:03 - User C :Launching a jab is a hard commitment though, right? Because I doubt you can react fast enough to seeing them jab and launch them.
25/07/23, 18:43 - User A :Where did he say he's superior to [NAME], anyway? 
25/07/23, 18:43 - User B  :Ozone Coffee near Old Street - Kiwi coffee shop; it‚Äôs great.
25/07/23, 19:05 - User C :I owe NOTHING and they take more than that every year ;)
25/07/23, 19:14 - User A :> no money at what normal, un-secterian people want! Surely not being sectarian should be considered normal in a civilised democratic society
25/07/23, 23:11 - User B  :EGG ROLLS. That's why your progress isn't good.
25/07/23, 23:13 - User C :Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol.
25/07/23, 23:15 - User A :The best losers of grand finals cod has ever seen
26/07/23, 08:41 - User B  :Gotta love how "QUESTIONING" is front and center in the list of things these warriors for [NAME] consider brainwashing.
26/07/23, 22:31 - User C :Can't wait for it.
26/07/23, 22:32 - User A :IMO 90% of articles on the internet, or in newspapers or TV news, are placed by PR firms. Only children don't know this.
26/07/23, 22:35 - User B  :Thank u! Looking for some new podcasts!
27/07/23, 00:30 - User C :too cold hurts my teeth, so i just drink whatever comes out of my sink
27/07/23, 01:05 - User A :This will not happen bru
27/07/23, 01:09 - User B  :**Who would win:** a team of 10+ moderators with libertarian principals or one person with a Python programming environment?
27/07/23, 08:31 - User C :I for one am happy for [NAME] ballin out. Now let's go win this game !!!!
27/07/23, 08:35 - User A :Thank you...next
27/07/23, 09:27 - User B  :Same. After that it‚Äôs unbearable. Plus, [NAME] appears. So. 
27/07/23, 09:31 - User C :I have no shame in saying I still have my blanket from when I was a child. And a favorite [NAME] plushie.
27/07/23, 09:33 - User A :> Still hard Phrasing. O_o Sorry, I couldn't resist.
27/07/23, 09:35 - User B  :What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.
27/07/23, 09:37 - User C :correct. [NAME] was our 3rd round pick. Hand lookin like the steal of the draft
27/07/23, 09:38 - User A :This is the first time in the last two years I've seen somebody compare current politics to a series other than Harry Potter
27/07/23, 09:52 - User B  :The barriers in large only exist with respect to Canadian oil. Other producers (with the exclusion of Venezuela ) seem to be enjoying a very profitable time.
27/07/23, 09:59 - User C :[NAME] someone kick this dork
27/07/23, 10:02 - User A :Grow a beard.
27/07/23, 10:02 - User B  :we deserve to lose after that
27/07/23, 10:03 - User C :Definitely not overreacting. Leave.
27/07/23, 10:05 - User A :Everyone started making remakes. Here is my favorite Lineage, too want, but why? People who love this game will also play it
27/07/23, 10:21 - User B  :Suddenly, I was awake.
27/07/23, 10:24 - User C :no you should try again
27/07/23, 10:27 - User A :I can't really provide anything to you that you haven't already deliberately misread yourself. I can't force you to be honest.
27/07/23, 10:27 - User B  :ya how dare anyone like live and breathe around you. another joy of life you must be in person
27/07/23, 12:33 - User C :It's better to say a moment like that could truly ignite her love for the game rather than putting a bit of a damper on it.
27/07/23, 12:46 - User A :What a good pupper
27/07/23, 13:23 - User B  :Probably left the crusts on ! Borderline abuse right there !
27/07/23, 17:01 - User C :I shook a hand that shook his hand once
27/07/23, 17:01 - User A :shaved definitely makes things more swampy for me. I need the hair to soak up the swamp
27/07/23, 17:03 - User B  :> modern art Modern art lasted from 1860 at the earliest to 1970 at the latest. Thanks for your art critique though, it was very informative.
27/07/23, 17:03 - User C :Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
27/07/23, 17:06 - User A :Would be nice.
27/07/23, 17:07 - User B  :Yay, coming out is hard, you're lucky that they didnt avoid you for the next month, I'm happy for you
27/07/23, 17:07 - User C :Thank you so much
27/07/23, 17:08 - User A :Knew you weren't from here. I don't believe your story though.
27/07/23, 17:08 - User B  :i love it when [NAME] injects himself with sassy serum üòä
27/07/23, 17:09 - User C :So thankful for the conclusion. Having no idea how this played out was definitely going to haunt me
27/07/23, 17:10 - User A :I'm [RELIGION] and I'm disgusting lol
27/07/23, 17:12 - User B  :Yeah well most species don't kill off their own species unless for territorial reasons which we do already
27/07/23, 17:14 - User C :THANK YOU!!! I‚Äôve been trying to figure out his name
27/07/23, 17:37 - User A :I think we need to start coming to grip with the true that TWOW and the series will not be completed.
27/07/23, 17:39 - User B  :He was young and he thought he was doing the right thing. No need to be rude about it.
27/07/23, 17:39 - User C :Another fun fact is that the survivors present at the campfire are the ones you most recently played as.
27/07/23, 17:59 - User A :"[NAME]!" *screeched the two apprentices as they tried to prove their worth to the the one who shall not be named*
27/07/23, 18:04 - User B  :Someone somewhere wants to be cuddled too. You'll never find that person if you don't talk to anyone you want to cuddle with.
27/07/23, 18:04 - User C :I'm sorry to hear this. I hope you can find something to make you feel happy in the new year.
27/07/23, 18:04 - User A :[NAME] to GB yesterday
27/07/23, 18:04 - User B  :Any rap song because I hate it
27/07/23, 18:04 - User C :She can take her boring, drunk husband with her. He's not interesting at all.
27/07/23, 18:04 - User A :This response is highly unexpected yet logical. I‚Äôm fixin to chew on it for a spell.
27/07/23, 18:05 - User B  :I hid there just about everytime. Was often the person complaining about, "stop dying", and, "hide BEFORE he hits 4 meat".
27/07/23, 18:07 - User C :I love it when kids shut down these tired lines we adults feed them. She probably needed that. Well done.
27/07/23, 18:09 - User A :That's not what is being contested here. Telling your kid something like this would certainly make you a bitch.
27/07/23, 18:10 - User B  :Who's cutting onions?!
27/07/23, 18:11 - User C :I'm concerned for my fellow redditor. You seem to not be feeling well, and hallucinating. Shall we have a mod come check on you? 
27/07/23, 18:12 - User A :I just came
27/07/23, 18:20 - User B  :Because there's such a thing as "too good to be true" and some people are still skeptical of that.
27/07/23, 18:20 - User C :This is why I came to the comments section
27/07/23, 18:20 - User A :Vote every one of them out that was quoted as being upset about the wire and not the corruption.
27/07/23, 18:20 - User B  :I don‚Äôt know why but watching this makes me super happy!
27/07/23, 18:20 - User C :I love this contract structure especially since [NAME] is only 31.
27/07/23, 18:20 - User A :[NAME] Instagram story last night had a Mexican dinner for two cooking at his home. I bet they're already together.
27/07/23, 19:00 - User B  :Thanks, I sort of bought myself the leadership role with that little stunt I pulled. I will do my best. 
27/07/23, 19:00 - User C :Intersectionality might seem strange at first, but it really is a good framework for understanding people‚Äôs individual struggles within the context of society‚Äôs biases.
27/07/23, 19:30 - User A :Had one good year that was it, then joins a god squad that struggles to qualify
27/07/23, 19:30 - User B  :I didn't say that or imply it, nice try.
27/07/23, 19:30 - User C :I love [NAME] as well! He seems like a genuinely nice celebrity
27/07/23, 19:32 - User A :i curse you
27/07/23, 19:33 - User B  :I really like the AussieBum jockstraps.
27/07/23, 19:37 - User C :Joining the server when everyone's at 1/4hp and out of ammo, with no damage to your...uh...living room. Yeah, ggwp.
27/07/23, 20:40 - User A :The more unattractive the leader looks now the more attractive the new one will look come 2020
27/07/23, 21:59 - User B  :haha love it!
27/07/23, 22:00 - User C :I hope you enjoy endless mosquitoes as the climate warms.
27/07/23, 22:02 - User A :> This is just a waste of time. Just like making portland denizens use their tax dollars to built a stadium
27/07/23, 22:02 - User B  :Lol why would anyone willingly go skew the curve against them you dumbmotherfucker.
27/07/23, 22:03 - User C :Super curious, commenting to check in.
27/07/23, 22:08 - User A :oh yah, no worries. I appreciate your time and thoughtfulness. 
27/07/23, 22:10 - User B  :GOOD [NAME] ALIGHTY, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF
27/07/23, 22:14 - User C :I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this. 
27/07/23, 22:34 - User A :wow. thank you. you dont know how badly i needed that tbh
27/07/23, 22:42 - User B  :Why is anyone surprised. It has never worked.
27/07/23, 23:43 - User C :* [NAME]: 17 million * [NAME]: 90 billion * [NAME]: 4 trillion I think that one question sums up the DLB Show perfectly.
27/07/23, 23:45 - User A :At the very least, I‚Äôm glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. 
28/07/23, 05:07 - User B  :What do you mean when you say picking a side of history
28/07/23, 05:34 - User C :Tbh if they were hopped up on drugs and harassing employees and customers alike, I would have just called the fuzz anonymously.
28/07/23, 05:35 - User A :My exact reaction
28/07/23, 05:35 - User B  :They are awesome!
28/07/23, 05:35 - User C :I have to admit, most of the worst people I have encountered in my life were met while LARPing.
28/07/23, 05:36 - User A :Tree house of horrors they are all great.
28/07/23, 06:36 - User B  :Cats/dogs for sure. It would be refreshing.
28/07/23, 06:42 - User C :Top female players including [NAME] practice against college men players and get beat a lot by them. I wouldn't be suprised to see [NAME] win even at 14..
28/07/23, 07:04 - User A :Short and sweet I like it.
28/07/23, 07:13 - User B  :Air Vooch oh my!
28/07/23, 07:36 - User C :This one's pretty fucking funny. Also LOL to that kid with that shotgun. The kick would break his shoulder in half.
28/07/23, 07:44 - User A :My husband and I have been circling the drain for years. :(
28/07/23, 07:57 - User B  :This episode also had the segment where a paralized [NAME] communicates by farting. So, yes it is the worst. Lisa Goes Gaga is a close second.
28/07/23, 08:15 - User C :YES they all going in on LIEda

30/08/23, 08:49 - User A :Not shocked by the subs [NAME] is active in...
30/08/23, 09:58 - User B  :IIRC there is a Simpsons episode where [NAME] has programmed the emergency button on the phone to call the pizza place.
31/08/23, 09:02 - User C :I play with all 20-24 year old so we most certainly did not hear the punishment on the radio. Not sure exactly where it came from though.
31/08/23, 16:57 - User A :For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!
31/08/23, 16:58 - User B  :I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, I‚Äôll drink a few extra for your fianc√©
31/08/23, 16:58 - User C :I once went alert on N1 and killed 3 people.. 2 maf and a doc. Doc got resurrected later thankfully
31/08/23, 17:01 - User A :It was magic.
31/08/23, 21:06 - User B  :THANK [NAME]
31/08/23, 21:12 - User C :There isn't. It only exists in the heads of those who subscribe to these tinfoil theories.
31/08/23, 21:27 - User A :[NAME]. It just seems like it‚Äôd be more fun.
31/08/23, 21:27 - User B  :Lol! Believe me I get it! Hell, even 11:00 might be pushing it ;-)

01/09/23, 08:37 - User B  :Could also mean that mutated versions of these plants could make excellent super weeds that destroy our infrastructure. Tree roots and weeds are already a huge problem.
01/09/23, 08:37 - User C :Currently cuddling the pillow because my husband got up...
01/09/23, 08:37 - User A :Because on a visa, I get 3 months of unemployment and I used up 2.5 when I got out of school first. 
01/09/23, 08:38 - User B  :I'm getting worried
01/09/23, 08:38 - User C :Gmail logo is based on the red and white freemason man apron. Not surprised.
01/09/23, 08:39 - User A :Im not üòÄ Glad you realize your mistake and why I was confused üòâ

01/09/23, 08:39 - User C :"Ummmmm *Eeyore*? Duh?" *sighs violently, rubs temples* (This is when I leave before I do/say something stupid)
01/09/23, 08:40 - User A :I hope everyone has a nice day.

01/09/23, 08:42 - User B  :and i answered, sorry if you can't follow. i agree that having a pet involves (unnecessarily) having power over a small animal. 
01/09/23, 08:43 - User C :I have been really close friends with her for over a year so I don't think that is the problem. I appreciate the comment though thank you.
01/09/23, 08:43 - User A :Change of top, pump, inner tubes, puncture repair kit & tyre levers, balaclava, lube. 
01/09/23, 08:45 - User B  :ok so that was fucking sick
01/09/23, 08:46 - User C :Do you know my ex husband? You sound so much like him according to his old coworkers.
01/09/23, 08:46 - User A :yeah I agree w you, just annoying that the limit is so small
01/09/23, 08:46 - User B  :Also, if you start looking for your partner to get mad at you when depression "kicks in" then you're probably starting it yourself. 
01/09/23, 08:47 - User C :They don‚Äôt have that on iOS unfortunately üò≠ but thank you for the suggestion!
01/09/23, 08:47 - User A :I assume the [NAME] announcement doesn't mean that his contract money comes off of the payroll?
01/09/23, 08:48 - User B  :I mean you could be one or a combination of those things, realistically. -_-
01/09/23, 08:48 - User C :so true cuz i‚Äôm pretty miserable but my instagram life looks amazing
01/09/23, 08:49 - User A :Is it because of the accents you thought they were the same?
01/09/23, 08:50 - User B  :This question was on here like 2 days ago with 95/5
01/09/23, 08:50 - User C :Nobody's mad at incels for being in pain. We're mad at them for letting that pain calcify into hate.
01/09/23, 08:50 - User A :Well thats survival sweety. Run away live to fight another day. You on the other hand are the one that learns the hard way and ends up dying first!
01/09/23, 08:50 - User B  :Marriage takes 2 to be successful. Love him enough to let him go.
01/09/23, 08:50 - User C :What was he ‚Äúhealing‚Äù you from?
01/09/23, 08:52 - User A :Oh look, they‚Äôre little footballs!
01/09/23, 08:54 - User B  :*sees title* hello there!
01/09/23, 08:55 - User C :You're right. I read that tweet and I think it dislodged from my brain because it just assumed nobody would argue something that utterly stupid.
01/09/23, 09:29 - User A :Kind of a lame duck President though.
01/09/23, 20:48 - User B  :so basically free money for those wealthy enough to take vacations annually. wonderful.
01/09/23, 20:51 - User C :@ the corner in Litchfield is really good and it‚Äôs in a picturesque area on the Litchfield green

04/09/23, 15:33 - User A :Maybe [NAME] would be like Old [NAME], jaded by a lifetime of tricking women into bed. 
04/09/23, 15:43 - User B  :Also the infection that almost killed her because they tried to save the leg, leading her to get the prosthesis. 
04/09/23, 15:45 - User C :He was so close to me x
04/09/23, 15:45 - User A :Oh, my [NAME]

04/09/23, 16:13 - User A :Didn't even realize that the Mazda was a competition. It's always a Camry and Accord.
04/09/23, 16:19 - User B  :Well with how often the VPD turns a blind eye downtown I promise you vigilante justice is coming.
04/09/23, 16:20 - User C :Except we've ACTUALLY seen coalitions basically fall apart after the local government elections.
04/09/23, 16:20 - User A :[NAME] hilarious

04/09/23, 17:02 - User C :This is either beautiful..or just about the stupidest thing I've read in weeks. Here's hoping for fantastic satire!
04/09/23, 17:03 - User A :There is no evidence connecting him to the crime.
04/09/23, 17:03 - User B  :Ill try my best. I can atleast try and looksmatch at 5'6. AlphaM is 5'6.
04/09/23, 17:04 - User C :yeah I don't get the hate for [NAME] regardless of the hustle thing, there were stretches where he was for real carrying the team hardcore.
04/09/23, 17:06 - User A :My hunch is, this is not the first or last wedding this bar has seen
04/09/23, 17:07 - User B  :PLANT LOCAL WILDFLOWERS!!!! They come back year after year and the Pollinators will Love it.
04/09/23, 17:07 - User C :Miz Cracker is the worst parts of Aquaria and Trixie. Unprofessional pettiness and shadiness of Aquaria and the slightly problematic and sometimes delusional humor of Trixie.
04/09/23, 17:08 - User A :Someone tell Disney. The evil mouse has sued daycare centers for painting Mickey on their walls, they sure as hell will sue for this abomination.
04/09/23, 17:14 - User B  :Hahahah thank you so much, username does not check out, you don't seem sketchy at all! üòÖ
04/09/23, 17:25 - User C :I have my kids signal ba√±o, the letter T in ASL so they don't disturb the class while asking. 
04/09/23, 17:26 - User A :It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now
04/09/23, 17:28 - User B  :Welp, my bad. Searched for "new year" and didn't see this so posted.
04/09/23, 17:29 - User C :Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable
05/09/23, 14:05 - User A :Omfg das a lotta snow. Maybe I'll get to pull out the gas powered snow thrower for the bloody first timeof the season.
05/09/23, 14:24 - User B  :It doesn't. It really doesn't. I just had a 2nd one a few weeks ago.
05/09/23, 14:25 - User C :Wow that's some great facts and logic you're arguing with.
05/09/23, 14:43 - User A :Did you really just link a study about partner violence and then equate that to the entirety of violence? Holy shrimp.
06/09/23, 08:35 - User B  :Never thought about it but it‚Äôs bloody obvious when pointed out! Good tip
06/09/23, 08:36 - User C :get the packages sent to your work or a relatives or trusted friends home nearby ???? parcel locker ??
06/09/23, 08:39 - User A :A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
06/09/23, 08:39 - User B  :Do you want help?
06/09/23, 08:40 - User C :The fact you have to explain this at the third grade level is pathetic. People think somone preventing his own murder is a tragedy.
06/09/23, 08:40 - User A :You think this really happened?
06/09/23, 08:43 - User B  :It‚Äôs interesting, especially if you do it every single day, but I‚Äôm here for it.
06/09/23, 08:47 - User C :[NAME] will never do anything to help you. You must stand up for yourself.
06/09/23, 08:50 - User A :It should be played between two biggest NCAA violators of the year as a punishment.

06/09/23, 08:52 - User A :What a charming puddle of smegma.
06/09/23, 08:59 - User B  :I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue.
06/09/23, 09:01 - User C :#THEY DON'T VOTE IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS, JUST LOCAL ONES *Takes a deep breath*
06/09/23, 09:01 - User A :I'm curious, too. 
06/09/23, 09:02 - User B  :HOLY SHIT CHANCE
06/09/23, 09:03 - User C :This article and the accompanying photos have gone viral. Anyone who knows him personally has probably read it. Dude's probably being shamed and humiliated as we speak
06/09/23, 09:05 - User A :[NAME], you are such a pretty girl. 
06/09/23, 09:06 - User B  :They're a Queens family. [NAME] would be one of those dudes who sits outside of Bodegas and bothers high school girls when they walk by.
06/09/23, 09:06 - User C :Confusingly, they also want less rights for [NAME].
06/09/23, 09:07 - User A :This is an old carnie trick. There are sites that have debunked this guy.
06/09/23, 09:07 - User B  :Thanks globalism!
06/09/23, 09:07 - User C :I was in awe the whole hour I spent in there.
06/09/23, 09:08 - User A :Please enlighten us
06/09/23, 09:13 - User B  :I feel like this is coming to NV soon as well, and I‚Äôm not so sure about how it will go
06/09/23, 09:14 - User C :I‚Äôd like to know too. How lucky am I that my first ever relationship was with a pwBPD. sigh
06/09/23, 09:15 - User A :She can also say she's committed to the public system while still wanting two tier. So what she said there truly means nothing.
06/09/23, 09:15 - User B  :Do you boo boo. Live your best life
06/09/23, 09:27 - User C :This happened at my local Odeon last night. The amount of confused faces was kinda funny to watch.
06/09/23, 09:28 - User A :Lame passing all night
06/09/23, 09:39 - User B  :Hey, at least he finds women!
06/09/23, 09:39 - User C :Ty! I was going crazy tryin it, canging things... i'l wait then :-)

06/09/23, 09:40 - User C :I knew her in high school- she's awesome!
06/09/23, 09:40 - User A :The [NAME] excuse needs to die. [NAME] was on the bench for an extended period when the Raps defence made [NAME] freaking [NAME] look like an all-star.
06/09/23, 09:40 - User B  :Thats absolutely disgusting.
06/09/23, 09:41 - User C :I wish that were a thing üôÑ
06/09/23, 09:45 - User A :> Update they would've never been arrested or charged if they weren't black. Epitome of the disgusting systemic racism in this country #UBERPOOLtoPrisonPipeline
06/09/23, 09:45 - User B  :I honestly don't know but the more attention something gets the less it gets ignored
06/09/23, 09:45 - User C :This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao
06/09/23, 09:48 - User A :Uhh have they really concreted those phone boxes shut?
06/09/23, 09:50 - User B  :Agreed. And I like how far you can see into the distance
06/09/23, 09:52 - User C :What a waste of packaging.
06/09/23, 09:52 - User A :Last year was Celtics and Sixers... that‚Äôs pretty decent
06/09/23, 09:53 - User B  :How can a picture hurt?
06/09/23, 09:53 - User C :Is that meat or veggies?
06/09/23, 09:54 - User A :Do you have a source for this? It wouldn't surprise me but I'm curious.
06/09/23, 09:57 - User B  :It's always bothered me. He reminds me of [NAME], coming in for the kiss with his mouth wide open!
06/09/23, 09:58 - User C :Someone who wants to do a couple of takes and it's just gone past 9
06/09/23, 09:59 - User A :You know a giant lady as a character would be very interesting in my opinion.
06/09/23, 10:05 - User B  :I love when he asks while looking directly at the item but still not seeing it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
06/09/23, 10:12 - User C :I got laid the first time directly after that game too Not sure if there's a correlation, just thought I'd contribute
06/09/23, 10:12 - User A :Interesting. I thought so too. I‚Äôm just thankful I have another parish I can easily drive to for mass. Thanks again
06/09/23, 10:12 - User B  :Just keep going and don't lose hope. Stuff like this can happen all the time to anybody. It's just bad luck
06/09/23, 10:12 - User C :I would feel like the biggest idiot if I made your comment.
06/09/23, 10:12 - User A :I'll never forget how great [NAME] was that day.
06/09/23, 10:12 - User B  :Also r/justnomil holy doodles man they are nutso.
06/09/23, 10:13 - User C :Don't see a W tonight. We need a miracle.
06/09/23, 10:13 - User A :Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
06/09/23, 10:13 - User B  :I was too legit. Too legit to quit. Now I‚Äôm not legit. I‚Äôm un-legit. And therefore, I must quit.
06/09/23, 10:13 - User C :Who delivers mail to the mail mans house
06/09/23, 10:13 - User A :He thought of it but we don't want his mother's house to be wrecked by the staff.
06/09/23, 10:13 - User B  :I wanna take the hardware out of that guy's face with a pair of pliers.
06/09/23, 10:15 - User C :There is so much positive support and affirmation in this thread and I love it. Congratulations OP.
06/09/23, 10:18 - User A :> I firmly believe "[NAME] have problems, [NAME] ARE problems! Holy shit, stealing this. Love it.
06/09/23, 10:22 - User B  :That explains an awful lot about ICP.
06/09/23, 10:22 - User C :If only they were more like [RELIGION] amirite?
06/09/23, 10:24 - User A :[NAME], you're annoying. Did [NAME] steal your girl or what? Everytime someone mentions [NAME] on this subreddit, you appear to trash talk him.
06/09/23, 10:24 - User B  :Cause his value is at the lowest now.. If he does improve and score goals for Monaco, he'll be sold in the summer. 
06/09/23, 10:24 - User C :Ghostbusters 2: ghost-bustier ?
06/09/23, 10:28 - User A :Yeah I‚Äôm working with my therapist to help me identify certain behaviors early and pay attention to the red flags.
06/09/23, 10:28 - User B  :This is my favorite meme that happened every year
06/09/23, 10:38 - User C :This is one of the worst I've seen...
06/09/23, 10:40 - User A :I cant wait. I'm curious if it will give us any more insight into the incident other than what we already know.
06/09/23, 10:42 - User B  :Paraphrasing: I saw [NAME]. No, wait. It was [NAME] and [NAME]. That's the ticket.
06/09/23, 10:45 - User C :All the time
06/09/23, 10:46 - User A :What? /s
06/09/23, 11:00 - User B  :men who drink almond milk regularly have more ejaculate fluid and experience multiple orgasms.
06/09/23, 11:15 - User C :That boy of yours is a real hero
06/09/23, 11:15 - User A :Just ride the subway in NYC and watch how everyone behaves. Don‚Äôt stare, though. 
06/09/23, 11:41 - User B  :Nothing has come close to it well except for GOT.
06/09/23, 11:43 - User C :good luck, little 3 year old
06/09/23, 11:45 - User A :There is zero conclusive evidence supporting this position.
06/09/23, 11:49 - User B  :my screen is 10 years old so the graphics are also horrible
06/09/23, 11:49 - User C :OwO what's this?
06/09/23, 11:53 - User A :Wait, am I the only one who thought [NAME] was the tallest since childhood?

06/09/23, 13:58 - User B  :If someone asked me, ‚Äúwhat truly stood out to you as a memory from this year,‚Äù my mind would be completely blank.
06/09/23, 14:07 - User C :Realize that all those feelings she had for you were lies. She is liar. Don't let her take up space in your head rent free.
06/09/23, 14:12 - User A :Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
06/09/23, 14:13 - User B  :Or maybe it was because the government can't collect the tax on it
06/09/23, 14:17 - User C :It‚Äôs a metaphor. No one cares how big his anatomy is.
06/09/23, 14:22 - User A :I agree with the last statement but apparently I'm also bad at matching pokemon to rep :(
06/09/23, 14:25 - User B  :For that tropical flavor
06/09/23, 15:23 - User C :Damn, and now this GIF has become bittersweet. I really wanted him to become a revolutionary icon.
06/09/23, 16:13 - User A :For free? Tell him you ain no prude. You want $100
06/09/23, 18:01 - User B  :I watched a couple Titan games. He used [NAME] and [NAME] very well. That alone gets me excited.
06/09/23, 23:14 - User C :[NAME] that was so stupid lol holy fuck wat
06/09/23, 23:17 - User A :I'm sorry for that.
07/09/23, 05:34 - User B  :Always thought [NAME] spear look lethal...especially compared to someone like [NAME].
07/09/23, 05:35 - User C :Yeah cause no man has ever been falsely imprisoned due to allegations proven later to be false
07/09/23, 08:47 - User A :Haha this is one of those moments that makes me laugh out loud
07/09/23, 08:47 - User B  :How right you are
07/09/23, 08:48 - User C :It's less about what actually happened. What's done is done. I just want her to know why sexual exclusivity was so important to me
07/09/23, 08:48 - User A :True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
07/09/23, 08:49 - User B  :#29 GINNNO ODJICK
07/09/23, 09:07 - User C :Then he is innocent. I'd rather have a president that we know for sure isnt undermining our democracy by conspiring with a foreign nation.
07/09/23, 09:10 - User A :Wasn‚Äôt the black saber first seen in the Clone Wars? But otherwise all true.
07/09/23, 09:33 - User B  :The hardest part is trying to figure out what anyone is talking about with all these F degrees.

07/09/23, 10:19 - User A :On the contrary, he gets off on his own ego and the delusion shattering reality of intimacy with another person makes him limp as a wet noodle.
07/09/23, 18:06 - User B  :On-court obnoxiousness should be punished and has nothing to do with the game of playing tennis. Bring your A game hitting the ball or walk off the field.

08/09/23, 13:53 - User B  :It's almost like OP is the real CB trying to make fun of people to get them mad and then screenshot it for karma
08/09/23, 14:05 - User C :Chattel slavery is uniquely different from other types of forced labour and indenture.
08/09/23, 14:14 - User A :Look at that shit-eating grin

10/09/23, 18:55 - User A :We should strip [NAME] of his Stoney badge for being so soft.
10/09/23, 18:56 - User B  :People only treat you the way you allow them to.
10/09/23, 18:56 - User C :[NAME] didn't want to deal with [NAME] (reasonable) and [NAME] had more foreign policy experience and credentials than [NAME] did at the time.
10/09/23, 18:59 - User A :Same here! I thought too long and hard about whether or not la jolla/Encinitas was known as the "treasure coast"

11/09/23, 14:20 - User B  :Apparently the bull shark is hyper aggressive due to the amount of testosterone it has. They're basically roid-heads in perpetual roid-rage with massive teeth.

12/09/23, 15:56 - User A :he can still be heard uttering "I'm a huge fan" alone in a dark room
12/09/23, 15:57 - User B  :Well regardless if I don't completely agree with your weights and measures of people. Thanks your input
12/09/23, 16:02 - User C :Haha dude, love your spirit. But. It's not all shit (the cuisine that is), let's not overgeneralize and become the shitheads we are criticizing.
12/09/23, 19:02 - User A :Great! I love hotsssssssssssss
12/09/23, 19:12 - User B  :Damned asshole trouble maker!! Someone has mummy issues. üëÄ
12/09/23, 23:10 - User C :It still wouldn't make sense. The problem isn't the looks
13/09/23, 08:24 - User A :I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with MHA, but this seems like a real bad idea
13/09/23, 08:25 - User B  :Oh man, how about when they played We Will Rock You to seemingly coordinate the "ref you suck" cheer. The crowd was awesome last night.
13/09/23, 08:25 - User C :Hm so sad. Am I supposed to feel bad for you because you don't look like [NAME] phelps? Btw, he's on steroids no doubt
13/09/23, 08:26 - User A :We've actually got scientists working on that. If you're 23 right now and healthy, you've got a fairly good chance of not dying.
13/09/23, 08:31 - User B  :This article wasn‚Äôt much better. The errors begin in the sixth paragraph. Thanks for sharing though!
13/09/23, 08:33 - User C :Oh right I was for reason thinking it was just made out with. Sleep with is even better. Sleep with [NAME], [NAME]!

13/09/23, 09:51 - User B  :"The first step, is to put on a set of vicious stilleto claws. This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character"

13/09/23, 10:05 - User A :That's really interesting. Thank you for the information. It's just hard to imagine lives you'll never live.
14/09/23, 08:31 - User B  :/s, you forgot this.
14/09/23, 14:21 - User C :What's your source for that? Just curious (and yes I know it sounds like a tired contrarian statement).
14/09/23, 14:43 - User A :An eye for a *dead*eye? I'm sorry...
15/09/23, 09:52 - User B  :Going through a divorce right now. Her saying "I love you and maybe we should go to counseling" would make me more than happy.
15/09/23, 09:59 - User C :This helped me put together some of my thoughts after watching last night, especially how vanilla and ineffective [NAME] looked. Thanks for taking the time to write this out
15/09/23, 14:04 - User A :[NAME] so cool
15/09/23, 14:05 - User B  :I have silvered it as it was what I was thinking and they beat me to it hahaha

17/09/23, 11:35 - User A :looks cool, i want it now.
18/09/23, 09:46 - User B  :Did he actually knock himself out?!
18/09/23, 09:46 - User C : Their official logic is that it reduces turn-over, but yeah, the other reasons are kind of obvious.
18/09/23, 18:25 - User A :Only after the initial vote is honored and brexit is implemented.
19/09/23, 10:48 - User B  :Mine do honestly, but I try not to use mine much when I‚Äôm in public with people because that‚Äôs tacky.
19/09/23, 12:27 - User C :Read his post again. 'It's more fact based than Fox.' I'm sorry but you might have some extra chromosomes.
19/09/23, 14:39 - User A :So people will support him in this fake news quick reaction political environment
19/09/23, 15:05 - User B  :He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states...
19/09/23, 15:31 - User C :Just speak with a Sheffield accent lmao
19/09/23, 15:32 - User A :literally I feel like crying
19/09/23, 15:33 - User B  :Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018.
19/09/23, 15:40 - User C :Indeed. I thought we are just spoiled, but apparently the phenomena is not exlusive to us.
19/09/23, 15:41 - User A :You haven‚Äôt missed anything. I looked out of curiosity and didn‚Äôt look twice. I was surprised that Colt would do that.
19/09/23, 15:41 - User B  :Your same-gender partner
19/09/23, 15:41 - User C :My favorite is when he puts his name at the end of the sentence like this. It makes his comment seem so Eloquent! Best, [NAME]
19/09/23, 15:42 - User A :Waking up covered in blood is terrifying but thankfully it was just a nosebleed
19/09/23, 15:42 - User B  :How strange is it that it is only gun control enthusiasts think that compromise means one side gets what it wants and the other side only loses.
19/09/23, 15:42 - User C :So she spat in the face of [NAME], nature and you by violating your health.
19/09/23, 15:43 - User A :Cheers to you for pushing through.
19/09/23, 15:43 - User B  :The unfortunate thing is that, right now, that **is** how it works in politics, it‚Äôs just been made extremely obvious the last few years. 
19/09/23, 15:44 - User C :If you think people in this sub are gonna get butt-hurt you are in for a pleasant surprise.
19/09/23, 15:45 - User A :Great post. ( you are learning to let it go)
19/09/23, 15:45 - User B  :But the best part is the struggle snuggle as we like to call it.
19/09/23, 15:45 - User C :Is he your source?
19/09/23, 15:46 - User A :It's a seemingly a pretty heavy duty trailer but definitely putting some stress on bearing assembly slamming a log into it sideways like that.
19/09/23, 15:46 - User B  :Good luck to you darling. I hope you feel strength and happiness.
19/09/23, 15:46 - User C :Then people clapped
19/09/23, 15:47 - User A :What a nutbar lol
19/09/23, 15:47 - User B  :I totally thought the same thing! I was like, oh honey nooooo!

19/09/23, 15:53 - User B  :for Inter fans because THEIR BEST PLAYER IS COMING TO CHELSEA THIS WINTER
19/09/23, 15:53 - User C :"You're going to get behind our anointed centrist establishment candidate and you're going to LIKE IT!" How did 2016 turn out for you again? 
19/09/23, 15:54 - User A :Oh, I realized that moments after rolling down my window, when his hand came through the space. 
19/09/23, 15:59 - User B  :hey the 5 riders per van per day are upset
19/09/23, 16:06 - User C :I mean, I hope so. I bought his jersey, which would be embarrassing if he was out the league in two years.
19/09/23, 16:12 - User A :So it's we now eh jerk-off, as in troll farm to creat FUD and drive the premium up on the order book. I knew it.
20/09/23, 08:44 - User B  :I worked at a hospital in northern NJ and float pool was only $4 extra
20/09/23, 08:46 - User C :He wants to be free to hit on other women. He may not take it any farther but that‚Äôs what it looks like to me.
20/09/23, 08:46 - User A :apparently since you won't do it
20/09/23, 09:36 - User B  :Totally agree, except I usually (this occasion included) lack the pity haha.
20/09/23, 09:47 - User C :How I met your mother with muscles
20/09/23, 10:03 - User A :You will have symptoms for a few more weeks while it kicks in, good luck, glad to see youre doing better
20/09/23, 10:31 - User B  :Is it possible you've been banned from them? I dont know how I feel about having the special privilege to view that sub lol.
20/09/23, 14:52 - User C :My cat just attacked me for treats and scratched me on the finger. If this affects my typing, he's in so much trouble.
20/09/23, 14:53 - User A :He already has a baby with his girlfriend who‚Äôs gorgeous
20/09/23, 14:54 - User B  :Lethargy and depression both make me personally expect to not go through that later in life dilemma but kudos for finding the cure.
20/09/23, 14:55 - User C :This. It seems he's undoubtedly [NAME] preferred option.
20/09/23, 14:55 - User A :My favorite new fan! Glad to see you here! Rest up and get ready for the Friday game.
20/09/23, 14:56 - User B  :Thank you! Completely agree.
20/09/23, 14:56 - User C :That woman gave me nightmares as a child. Also, you probably know this but she also plays [NAME] aunt in the third movie!
20/09/23, 14:57 - User A :We never knew what friends we had, until we came to Lehningrad
20/09/23, 14:57 - User B  :Jeez I just did those for fun but good luck
20/09/23, 14:58 - User C :I'm Tent

20/09/23, 15:00 - User C :Hot bath helps me, or just heating pad on my breasts. Looks awkward, but it helps. 
20/09/23, 15:01 - User A :Why don‚Äôt you just *get the fuck out* of Edmonton if you hate it so much?
20/09/23, 15:02 - User B  :[NAME] - Holdin on. Check out his music because he is honestly amazing.
20/09/23, 15:02 - User C :No one has asked yet. So...how?!

20/09/23, 20:37 - User C :Not sure why he's shilling for [NAME].
20/09/23, 20:38 - User A :I hope they appreciate the fact someone is getting up earlier than them in order for this to all work. I appreciate you, and I'm unemployed.
20/09/23, 20:40 - User B  :The UN said the election was a sham. The man is causing death destruction and starvation. Your morals are completely and utterly fucked.
20/09/23, 20:41 - User C :I don't understand how her hair is 'too light' or how that effects the concealer.

04/10/23, 20:41 - User A :It's the [NAME] of hot dogs

04/10/23, 20:41 - User C :I said this somewhere else.. but I swear that man in the hood is caucasian... But that was actually hilarious

04/10/23, 21:01 - User B  :Ah, the old [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] to [NAME] pipeline.
04/10/23, 22:52 - User C :Lovely. If you have no success in finding a copy I'd be more than happy to post it to you.
04/10/23, 22:53 - User A :Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
04/10/23, 22:53 - User B  :100 chapters of relationship + 50 of build up after [NAME] left [NAME]. Damn you Sasuga T.T
05/10/23, 10:02 - User C :haha! She is so creepy at times. What a great actress.
05/10/23, 10:02 - User A :They did this at one of my jobs. The icing on the 'fuck you cake' was the drivers' last day was 4 days before Christmas.
05/10/23, 10:03 - User B  :I'll see if I can find it Found it!
05/10/23, 10:05 - User C :Thank you; this is really helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è
05/10/23, 10:39 - User A :Hunting would at least be more rewarding and fun. Every time I wanna meal prep in RDO I just horseback ride and lock-on to deer.
05/10/23, 10:43 - User B  :... that's simply wrong.
05/10/23, 12:56 - User C :Mom said it was my time on the repost!!
05/10/23, 14:50 - User A :Nah eats the heads when he‚Äôs finished with them. I punt them so I can buy fresh meat.
05/10/23, 14:53 - User B  :Very reassuring. Thank you for the effort you took to escalate this with cc and posting their detailed response. Appreciate it!!
05/10/23, 14:54 - User C :So in 1 year she goes from nothing to a [NAME] master capable of training others?
05/10/23, 16:40 - User A :You're a normie in loner's clothing. If you think that most of us haven't tried all of the above already, you're sorely mistaken.
05/10/23, 17:47 - User B  :Imagine buying a product, then burning it in protest 
05/10/23, 17:47 - User C :I‚Äôm glad you had a great time here! Wishing you safe travels!
05/10/23, 17:57 - User A :Yeah nice one dude
05/10/23, 18:31 - User B  :I hate you for that title. Thanks a lot. /s Right as I‚Äôm about to go to sleep too.
05/10/23, 21:42 - User C :Incoming 20m a year contract [NAME] !!!
06/10/23, 10:59 - User A :[NAME] are proof of this.
06/10/23, 11:03 - User B  :step 1: remove yourself from the mass media
06/10/23, 11:04 - User C :It‚Äôs always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they‚Äôre on camera
06/10/23, 12:20 - User A :Man lucky guy i just wish it could have been me. I could do the same but different of course. Let me Know
06/10/23, 12:36 - User B  :BAT OLA?
06/10/23, 12:36 - User C :Thank you so much!!! You are truly a lifesaver
06/10/23, 12:38 - User A :Fall of religion also plays a role. I'm not religious at all, but I understand how it brought people together as far as a community structure. 
06/10/23, 12:38 - User B  :Its a bit weird of them to recommend you a song by The Strokes after they told you their offer
06/10/23, 12:39 - User C :Okay cool. Gonna drive home from the hospital.
06/10/23, 12:39 - User A :Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
06/10/23, 12:39 - User B  :I really love how this team responds to injuries
06/10/23, 12:39 - User C :I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.
06/10/23, 12:39 - User A :Op gets wooooshed
06/10/23, 12:39 - User B  :Yeah. Unless you live in a desert, ditch the scarcity mindset. It can keep you in relationships that aren't any good.
06/10/23, 12:39 - User C :No, because vaccines are recommended worldwide. And also, not amputating a body part.
06/10/23, 12:39 - User A :Lol, this one‚Äôs great too!
06/10/23, 12:41 - User B  :Definitely not just on this sub. I keep seeing them on Instagram too.
06/10/23, 12:41 - User C :My guess is they work with older folks
06/10/23, 12:43 - User A :No you don't. The average opinion of ISIS for example is way below zero.
06/10/23, 12:44 - User B  :Are 3% of [NAME] really vegan?? That‚Äôs fantastic!
06/10/23, 18:12 - User C :This was one of the best Reddit reads in a long time... great job.
07/10/23, 10:17 - User A :Don't play dumb we all know what you were implying, you racist nazi. 
07/10/23, 23:26 - User B  :Clear eyes.
07/10/23, 23:30 - User C :Thanks. I needed to hear that.
08/10/23, 07:42 - User A :Was it this?
08/10/23, 09:51 - User B  :Manila and Mon√©t serving a lot of emotion for safe
08/10/23, 11:02 - User C :I think I saw some eyeball flying!
08/10/23, 11:04 - User A :Ah well the Devs change the cle all the time and this was knowledge from before new year. I forgot they changed it a while ago again.
08/10/23, 11:23 - User B  :Yeah, sure, but it's beatable. It's made to be beaten, not otherwise. That's what I meant with my speech.
08/10/23, 11:28 - User C :My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
08/10/23, 11:31 - User A :Flush the toilet that's a deduction.
08/10/23, 11:46 - User B  :i said first world :)
08/10/23, 11:51 - User C :At the same time, if the camera quality is so shitty you can be certain the mic is too.
08/10/23, 12:02 - User A :Stay there it‚Äôs been good luck
08/10/23, 16:14 - User B  :What was the end result of this?
09/10/23, 10:36 - User C :It's not an conscious choice to be uncomfortable about something.
09/10/23, 11:20 - User A :THANK YOU [NAME]
09/10/23, 13:58 - User B  :Not journalists...media activists.
09/10/23, 15:26 - User C :UN report says population before war: 300,000 [NAME] population before war: 2,000,000
09/10/23, 15:27 - User A :Must be so frustrating having the wrong old man facing their own shutdowns.
09/10/23, 19:07 - User B  :I believe it was a severe dislocation as opposed to a fracture. Regardless....poor guy....
09/10/23, 19:09 - User C :I wish [NAME] would debate [NAME], if he was alive :(. 
09/10/23, 19:11 - User A :I enjoy gameplay grind. Don't shoot me lol.
09/10/23, 22:11 - User B  :All children should be given the option to learn about how to effectively use the rights they‚Äôre entitled to.
09/10/23, 22:11 - User C :The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD.
09/10/23, 22:11 - User A :So true! I‚Äôve always wondered why this is? I‚Äôm skinny as all hell and ppl tell me this all the time lol.
10/10/23, 08:27 - User B  :It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
10/10/23, 09:43 - User C :Yes dumbest person on all of Reddit, please make a youtube channel for all of us to laugh at.
10/10/23, 09:44 - User A :i think [NAME]
10/10/23, 09:50 - User B  :When hes nailing threes though its a glorious thing.
10/10/23, 09:51 - User C :It‚Äôs not even bad. Some people love dark humor, especially when delivered in a super serious way.
10/10/23, 09:52 - User A :Ohhh lol, gross and funny
10/10/23, 10:19 - User B  :good luck watching your career tank when you insist on working with a person because of their gender rather than their skill and talent..
10/10/23, 10:23 - User C :INFJ hands down "Being organised brings joy to me"
10/10/23, 12:27 - User A :> Clothing predates religions though Can you cite that? It seems like a somewhat interesting question.
10/10/23, 12:29 - User B  :Lol, pinches narizones.. Their physical game is on another level. Would rather play with a guy like that instead of against him though that's for sure.
10/10/23, 20:10 - User C :Thank you for being the voice of reason in the calamity that is Walmart.
10/10/23, 20:11 - User A :Rover has treated us well.
10/10/23, 21:45 - User B  :Please explain more
10/10/23, 21:46 - User C :Not any weirder than male doctors handling women junk for centuries.
10/10/23, 21:47 - User A :Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.
10/10/23, 21:47 - User B  :My friend and I have been having good fun queuing Mei/Winston, trololo, and 2 bottles of whisky.
10/10/23, 21:48 - User C :I am assuming since it's shut down, no one can access the website to change these things. They are most likely delayed.
10/10/23, 21:52 - User A :Kk cause I love touching up my tops so I'm just making sure üòÇ &#x200B;
10/10/23, 21:53 - User B  :[NAME] that's rough. Thanks for explaining
10/10/23, 21:54 - User C :Did the words get unbanned?!
10/10/23, 22:14 - User A :Bro we were all aasim at that moment
10/10/23, 22:48 - User B  :When you see this format you know its cancer
10/10/23, 22:49 - User C :At least you can skip it
11/10/23, 00:04 - User A :No, my point is that looking to past behaviors isn‚Äôt indicative of what is right and virtuous 
11/10/23, 10:14 - User B  :I'm 39 and still love being given chocolate.
11/10/23, 16:09 - User C :Is this really a bad thing? Even if you don't wanna lose your virginity yet, just cuddling is great.
11/10/23, 18:29 - User A :All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
11/10/23, 20:54 - User B  :I thought about it before. But I'm afraid I might get in trouble.
11/10/23, 20:55 - User C :I am ashamed of your sequel memes. Prequel memes or no memes
12/10/23, 09:26 - User A :He's gonna say "stop eating chips"
12/10/23, 12:09 - User B  :I'm not a fan of the model and the animations in general. He looks incredibly slapdash.
13/10/23, 16:14 - User C :No, he wasn't the entire problem, but his performance can't be excused by coaching alone. He's just not very good.
13/10/23, 17:38 - User A :Contracts & money in rtts mean absolutely nothing. Just one of the many missed opportunities year after year
13/10/23, 17:40 - User B  :> People on the team needs to be cool. yup, totally 2016(my csgo trading days) in a straight line.
14/10/23, 09:38 - User C :I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
14/10/23, 09:39 - User A :feeling like im not normal and that im shameful and wrong and other people telling me those things are what have done this to me
14/10/23, 09:39 - User B  :She does NOT love you. Try to ask yourself why you are accepting this treatment.
14/10/23, 09:39 - User C :So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
14/10/23, 09:40 - User A :[NAME] get better overtime. [NAME] would wreck [NAME].
14/10/23, 09:40 - User B  :you can bring all your cards to the game
14/10/23, 09:40 - User C :Probably the most rational way to look at this entire scenario - thanks for posting this my dude. That comment set me straight again.
14/10/23, 09:41 - User A :I‚Äôm really late here, but I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you.
14/10/23, 13:39 - User B  :Alright, I'm all ears as to what the HUGE difference is.
14/10/23, 14:38 - User C :Growing up in Chicago this was my life. Pissed he didn‚Äôt make it.
14/10/23, 17:15 - User A :Oh no here come the fanboys and girls, dude... RUUUNNN
16/10/23, 08:27 - User B  :Yeah, it'll be a pretty strong 3 team race among the Nats Braves & Phillies! It'll be fun to watch it from afar!
16/10/23, 19:32 - User C :yes, agreed. 
16/10/23, 19:32 - User A :Probably also saves money. An extra 3 napkins you dont use each time multiplied by thousands of people per day adds up quick
16/10/23, 19:32 - User B  :Downvoting because of a lack of funny, regardless of your clumsy attempt to insinuate that my doing so means I'm thin skinned.
16/10/23, 19:36 - User C :Couldn't agree more.
16/10/23, 19:37 - User A : You're welcome, I think.
16/10/23, 19:38 - User B  :Yup, the cammer is at fault here.
16/10/23, 19:57 - User C :Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. 
16/10/23, 19:58 - User A :Gotcha. That can happen sometimes too but make sure you follow up with your gyno just incase.
16/10/23, 20:03 - User B  :That's literally the science of it.
16/10/23, 20:08 - User C :Wait, they're not? *looks closer* Huh.
16/10/23, 20:16 - User A :Move bitch get out the way.
16/10/23, 20:16 - User B  :Did they name Gen X after all the porn they consume?
16/10/23, 20:24 - User C :To me it‚Äôs sounds like he is trying to find fault in her to make himself feel better about leaving her.
16/10/23, 20:59 - User A :Caution: [NAME]
16/10/23, 21:01 - User B  :It smelled even worse than it sounds. You learn just how quickly someone's feet can rot and really stink up an entire bay.
16/10/23, 21:04 - User C :No op. No one had ever done that.
16/10/23, 21:14 - User A :No but it should be
16/10/23, 21:35 - User B  :From an Instagram post about the judge critiquing [NAME] look
16/10/23, 21:47 - User C :When a dog brinks you it's toy, that's the sweetest thing it can do :)
16/10/23, 21:47 - User A :He must've done something real bad. I played with a guy who by all counts was an asshole but never received more than mutes.
17/10/23, 08:11 - User B  :we need his euro step comp with this in the background [NAME]
17/10/23, 09:22 - User C :[NAME] was actually wrong all along. JAH > Jokic /s
17/10/23, 10:05 - User A :bored waiting for the game [NAME]
17/10/23, 10:20 - User B  :I always feel like cute gay couples have a pug...
17/10/23, 10:25 - User C :Thanks. That makes me feel a little less lazy and a little more responsible
17/10/23, 10:32 - User A :I f a picture and not realizing it until it bursts. [NAME].
18/10/23, 08:36 - User B  :Russia is at war with the tchetchen , no ?
18/10/23, 08:44 - User C :I believe in you. Do what is right for you. I hope you feel better soon too. ‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ
18/10/23, 08:55 - User A :I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience.
18/10/23, 08:59 - User B  :Ahaha it's his mother's fault!
18/10/23, 10:25 - User C :Some drown. Others look to the sky. I thought it was a blog.
18/10/23, 14:18 - User A :I am truly sorry for you because that "song" is so awful
19/10/23, 10:08 - User B  :Unblockable feint dodge light beats a roll on reaction to the unblockable.
19/10/23, 10:47 - User C :Everyone has their own preferences I happen to play better when I have multiple balls in my pockets.... no pun intended
19/10/23, 10:47 - User A :Think of his target audience. They‚Äôre the ones who are fooled by talkers, not thinkers.
19/10/23, 10:47 - User B  :Yep, minimizing massively
19/10/23, 10:48 - User C :[NAME] throwing the ball to Spain
19/10/23, 10:49 - User A :/lookz at self in the
19/10/23, 11:35 - User B  :Hahahahhahhaha!!! Thats the right wing in a nutshell.....
19/10/23, 11:56 - User C :I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
20/10/23, 14:32 - User A :Ah okay, thanks!
20/10/23, 18:41 - User B  :Someone did. The person who impregnated them. Humans don't reproduce asexually, you can't just make yourself pregnant
22/10/23, 16:53 - User C :No haha but this is our first day on Reddit!
22/10/23, 16:54 - User A :You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
22/10/23, 16:56 - User B  :Congrats, darling! That is a monumentally meaningful accomplishment. I'm both happy for and proud of you <3
22/10/23, 17:37 - User C :Wait what...
22/10/23, 18:15 - User A :You shut your mouth
22/10/23, 18:16 - User B  :Hurr durr everyone needs to worry about other people‚Äôs problems
22/10/23, 18:17 - User C :Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?
22/10/23, 18:42 - User A :I'm confused. Where did I propose anything? I'm just describing how things currently work and what to consider...
22/10/23, 22:18 - User B  :The opposite of depression isnt happiness, its vitality.
22/10/23, 22:19 - User C :Thanks, it‚Äôs funny how to me this seemed a leap but not one person agrees, lol
24/10/23, 14:17 - User A :Cheers, mate! I know you can do it! :)
25/10/23, 10:36 - User B  :Feeling is exhausting. They used to feel those things and now they feel nothing because they're so burnt out and tired
25/10/23, 13:16 - User C :He actually did, couldn't believe it.
25/10/23, 13:44 - User A :Didn't [NAME] say that [NAME] was going to be on?
25/10/23, 13:51 - User B  :No shit. Stupidest idea having a safe place for junkies to get fucked up.
25/10/23, 13:54 - User C :You have selected POWER DRIVE
26/10/23, 09:14 - User A :Yeah I go to sleep hoping it's one of those days...
26/10/23, 15:45 - User B  :And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.
26/10/23, 16:08 - User C :Hey it's really green here right now thanks to the last few rainy months!
26/10/23, 16:42 - User A :Thats....that's pretty normal...prolly somewhere in the ballpark of 280miles...If you dont have a fuel efficient car its not hard to do.
26/10/23, 17:53 - User B  :Probably yes. Impossible to say without details. Has he tried giving the bill to his insurance?
26/10/23, 17:54 - User C :Analytics and instagram... are you joking?
26/10/23, 17:58 - User A :fellow trans guy with an nmom. i know what youre going through. it absolutely sucks. im sorry man. my PMs are open.
26/10/23, 17:58 - User B  :I like it better this way!
26/10/23, 18:04 - User C :Ouch!!!!! That hurt me just watching.
26/10/23, 18:06 - User A :Can‚Äôt really do much about it since our only other ball handler available today is Napier
26/10/23, 18:08 - User B  :Do you have any tinder picture or bio advice? I have no selfies or mirror pics but still not doing very well
26/10/23, 18:35 - User C :I fucking wish
26/10/23, 18:35 - User A :Nope, works just fine. Was just there.
26/10/23, 18:35 - User B  :I'd make that trade and I don't even like big macs.
26/10/23, 18:37 - User C :>All men cheat, you might as well get cheated on by a rich man! Kudos on the level of misanthropy. 
26/10/23, 18:38 - User A :Ok im om the hunt thanks
26/10/23, 18:38 - User B  :Lmaoo a team full of [NAME] blunders, sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs sabotage from the man above 
26/10/23, 18:38 - User C :I had a huge crush on the lead singer back in the day. Still have no idea what this song is about but love it.
26/10/23, 18:38 - User A :BDS is a discriminatory bigoted hateful movement. It's not just "Oh, I disagree with some things that Israel has done."
26/10/23, 18:38 - User B  :Same for me, feels like i've been made alone just so my brother can get all the attention
26/10/23, 18:38 - User C :What a legend
26/10/23, 18:39 - User A :That's the biggest annoyance I have with this sub the past year; how little people value [NAME]. I don't get it.
26/10/23, 18:55 - User B  :My "three B's" were specifically moderate guys who'll pull support from [NAME]. There's not much overlap between [NAME] base and hers.
26/10/23, 18:56 - User C :The song must be thrilling
26/10/23, 19:16 - User A :All right then, what‚Äôs your source?
27/10/23, 09:42 - User B  :Love this guy, love this team
27/10/23, 09:48 - User C :Man I love Canadaüá®üá¶
27/10/23, 09:48 - User A :I'd piss right on their floor. Fuck this.
27/10/23, 09:49 - User B  :Very clever!
27/10/23, 10:15 - User C :It‚Äôs endless the amount of white papers written in the last 3/4 years. Not one has been any good or any use
27/10/23, 10:51 - User A :Combination of lapses in defense and the continuing saga of the Sabres' god awful PP.
27/10/23, 11:40 - User B  :Ahh. Both of those are very good. Hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

01/11/23, 10:19 - User A :Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too.
01/11/23, 11:05 - User B  :I want to wipe her entire face off the face of earth
01/11/23, 16:14 - User C :That's freedom of speech for you. We have to give even the assholes a chance to talk, because the alternatives are worse.
01/11/23, 17:10 - User A :Wow, not exactly a complimentary typo.

07/11/23, 09:43 - User C :It seems some people on here don't like us disrupting their echo chamber.
07/11/23, 09:47 - User A :No, but when you're family sees, like, 12 books of it, it can certainly make things awkward.
07/11/23, 12:58 - User B  :The wage, you Fucking troll. But you don't care do you? See your post history.
07/11/23, 12:59 - User C :It's fascinating how each language originated isn't it but the how it happened is beyond my scope.So I don't dwell much upon it.
07/11/23, 13:25 - User A :He meant if the comedian made a joke specifically about his grandpa, not any old grandpa, its when it is personal.
08/11/23, 14:00 - User B  :Really? it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen.
08/11/23, 14:00 - User C :That mustache looks like it smells.

08/11/23, 14:07 - User B  :I was going to ask what temperatures are like where you live. The beauty of losing refrigeration in the winter is having the great outdoors.

09/11/23, 13:59 - User A :My 7 year old was so stoked to find out that there‚Äôs a place called Castle Danger in his state.

20/11/23, 08:19 - User B  :what the fuck do you learn in first grade that‚Äôs so important anyway?
20/11/23, 11:04 - User C :I thought they were talking about the cat.
20/11/23, 11:06 - User A :I can't help but agree with the headline at the bottom, bright side (the YouTube channel) is annoying.
20/11/23, 11:07 - User B  :Every other way sounds wrong. SPR for life.

20/11/23, 19:38 - User B  :Wow... I‚Äôm so glad that my dog is lazy like me.

21/11/23, 12:55 - User C :You have your opinion and I have mine why does that make only one of us a victim?
21/11/23, 13:00 - User A :Your smartly worded refutation of the whole of the rest of Christendom has swayed me completely, Rome is the only true home! Hurrah! Hurrah!
22/11/23, 15:20 - User B  :to be fair that's most fanbases (and especially those of teams with losing records for a few years like ours)
22/11/23, 15:21 - User C :Just let your kid know you are disappointed in them and be done with it. Everyone will be better for it.
22/11/23, 15:21 - User A :Just wanted to mention--Brazos Bend is closed due to flooding until next week.
22/11/23, 15:21 - User B  :Hell yeah. Happy they pulled it off together for their city. This is a great story in [NAME] eventual great career

22/11/23, 15:31 - User C :9Gag was my jam back in high school! Pleasure to meet an alumni
22/11/23, 15:33 - User A :Hold my wine, I have to go vomit in sorrow.

22/11/23, 15:55 - User C :Yeah, that one. I forgot the name earlier.
22/11/23, 15:57 - User A :Still makes no sense how [NAME] beat corrupted [NAME] while [NAME] and [NAME] couldn't beat his normal version
22/11/23, 15:58 - User B  :Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.
22/11/23, 15:59 - User C :why does this feel like rightwing propaganda made because they are pant shittingly terrified of her...
22/11/23, 16:12 - User A :>Shouldn‚Äôt the Bible be infallible No. That would be idolatry. Only [NAME] is infallible,
22/11/23, 16:32 - User B  :this is the best thing I have read in awhile. so simple yet so hiarious.
22/11/23, 16:32 - User C :I really enjoyed it actually. The world and the monster seemed really cool an original idea.
22/11/23, 16:32 - User A :I feel so bad for [NAME]. It was probably hard to concentrate on this match with the things going on in his personal life
22/11/23, 16:32 - User B  :Anarchist to cop: "Stop beating people!" Cop: "Stop imposing your morality on me, you lifestylist!"
22/11/23, 16:32 - User C :Bloody useless Pakistan

22/11/23, 16:34 - User C :If an AI projectile is your biggest problem you've got bigger issues, next. 
22/11/23, 16:34 - User A :Pure asshole.
22/11/23, 16:34 - User B  :209 comments and we don‚Äôt get to read any? All that good pasta advice going to waste. Shame.

22/11/23, 16:38 - User B  :Lol yeah. It‚Äôs cute that he said it but didn‚Äôt realise it could have a double meaning.
22/11/23, 16:38 - User C :Contentious statements cause unrest in public forum. In other news water is wet.
22/11/23, 16:41 - User A :I carry on an empty. But I also carry a single action. So don't make my mistakes.
22/11/23, 16:42 - User B  :This is a gift for my rematch secret Santa recipient. I hope they‚Äôre both confused and amused.

22/11/23, 18:52 - User B  :Your house/estate must be first on the route. Delivery normally starts at 8am.
22/11/23, 18:52 - User C :What made you so interested in great whites?
22/11/23, 18:52 - User A :You are. It's the cat. She looked away right when you turned the camera over towards her. She'd deliberately trying to mislead you.

22/11/23, 19:11 - User A :You will never have as many girls interested in you as when you have a girlfriend. They can smell it

28/11/23, 13:40 - User C :Pray. I remember that happening a couple weeks ago when the whole system went down internationally. Maybe check your connection and refresh, all that jazz.
28/11/23, 13:40 - User A :It doesn't really matter because since BF came out on console it's slowly become shit. :)
28/11/23, 13:41 - User B  :Why not? Just go for it. It'll make a great story to tell at your 50th wedding anniversary party.
28/11/23, 13:42 - User C :Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
28/11/23, 13:42 - User A :I mean...that‚Äôs quite obvious. I‚Äôm just left wondering what the other item is. 2/10
28/11/23, 13:43 - User B  :Not to mention the small electronic machines that we all carry around in our pockets. It'll be interesting to see how this impacts online casinos that accept cryptocurrency.
28/11/23, 15:06 - User C :A good therapist can lead you to talking about what you need to talk about once they get to know you and your emotions and trends

28/11/23, 15:58 - User C :I'm sure there's a trash bag full of 'em around there somewhere. Probably next to the insulin. You want some?

30/11/23, 11:41 - User B  :And I can't call the capitol switchboard to express my concern about this because the government is shut down. Awesome.
30/11/23, 11:42 - User C :Who cares? 2019 season hasn‚Äôt even started
30/11/23, 11:44 - User A :Okay, thank you so much!

30/11/23, 11:46 - User B  :*10 minutes of awkward roleplay*
30/11/23, 11:49 - User C :And just the ‚Äústop looking at me‚Äù was so old school. It was nice!
30/11/23, 11:49 - User A :Nobody should keep any around that is this ass-cracked to oblivion.
30/11/23, 12:01 - User B  :I don't know you or your story, but I fucking love your syntax, word choice, etc 10/10 would trip with

02/12/23, 10:34 - User A :The stuff nightmares are made of. Those poor poor timelines.
02/12/23, 10:39 - User B  :And let me guess, is our friend [NAME] also shilling his own coin that solves all the problems?
02/12/23, 10:39 - User C :only Beijing? Forbidden City and national museum are great , $100 pre day would be enough to find a decent hotel.
02/12/23, 18:30 - User A :>Feminism is how we get to equality how do you know that?

03/12/23, 11:42 - User C :You've shifted the goalposts from first novel to first modern novel... You people always complain that incels don't provide any support for their claims.
03/12/23, 12:41 - User A :Why was it changed to that? An overreaction. Why is it still like that? Laziness or incompetence, take your pick. Edit: clarity

10/12/23, 13:05 - User B  :Sure dude. Although I‚Äôd say my rate at dispensing profound wisdom is lesser than the rate at which I can talk utter BS haha

10/12/23, 19:51 - User C :Yeah that's not almost a semi auto. And the slam fire is vastly over rated.
11/12/23, 11:41 - User A :It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
11/12/23, 11:43 - User B  :As a lifelong single person, [NAME] offends me. Feels like I'm apart of some demographic that they can live without :(
11/12/23, 11:43 - User C :As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.

19/12/23, 11:19 - User B  :This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.

19/12/23, 12:52 - User A :If you're not helpless so be super easy to fix.
19/12/23, 13:24 - User B  :This is exactly what I‚Äôve been thinking!
19/12/23, 16:12 - User C :Like many TIFU posts, I don't believe this one.
19/12/23, 18:04 - User A :Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS
19/12/23, 20:33 - User B  :In my opinion, there should have never been a canon character... Maybe keeping it a mystery would be the BEST!

20/12/23, 20:38 - User B  :It's not as if she was my supervisor at bestbuy lol.
21/12/23, 11:55 - User C :Imagine being so deluded you believe that not condoning a country‚Äôs poor behavior will lead to war
21/12/23, 11:56 - User A :They put him on a minutes restriction for some reason, guessing cause he's not in really good shape?

21/12/23, 14:47 - User B  :Pretty sure it‚Äôs a reference to Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúBird Box‚Äù movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.

21/12/23, 15:06 - User C :I agree. There was just a big disconnect. They weren't talking specifically about masculinity but about certain situations that are toxic.

26/12/23, 12:33 - User C :Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that.
26/12/23, 12:37 - User A :Sacrilege! :-P
26/12/23, 12:42 - User B  :I miss the bch/bsv war...the quality of posts were getting better....back to square 1
26/12/23, 12:45 - User C :Glad to have you here :)
26/12/23, 13:16 - User A :When he puts it in too fast and you don't have time to let your walls expands, this is exactly how it feels... 
26/12/23, 19:43 - User B  :As I‚Äôve said in other comments, the increase in the cost of carbon makes it regressive. The rebates make them progressive.
26/12/23, 19:44 - User C :Ignore the trolls this is a fantastic idea.
26/12/23, 19:44 - User A :But they didn't because it's fake.
26/12/23, 19:45 - User B  :>Dumb, but wonderful. That's my kind of a pet. Silly,soft and adorable. 
26/12/23, 20:58 - User C :Thanks... that's the laugh I needed today.
26/12/23, 20:59 - User A :Likely frostbite advisory weather.
26/12/23, 21:01 - User B  :I never went back to the post to see if it was BOA, but I‚Äôm not surprised if it was. That was my first guess. 
26/12/23, 21:03 - User C :It‚Äôs more like a bunch of vaguely veiled racists and sexists and MAGAtards. Unless that‚Äôs what you consider ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
26/12/23, 21:04 - User A :‚ÄúGuys watch out, the scary looking kid is coming down the hall‚Äù
26/12/23, 21:13 - User B  :That‚Äôs a cute doggo! What breed?
26/12/23, 21:19 - User C :That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a repost. To anyone who‚Äôs cake day is 2 dayü§ó
26/12/23, 21:22 - User A :Damn, thanks for the source!
26/12/23, 21:24 - User B  :That and losing [NAME]. The two of them had instant chemistry. Excited to see is he can become a big part of our offense next year.
26/12/23, 21:24 - User C :[NAME] has the same amount of points as [NAME]
26/12/23, 21:25 - User A :People are disgusting and insane.
26/12/23, 21:25 - User B  :I sent this to my mom and she actually watched it
26/12/23, 21:41 - User C :You're right. Sorry for the poor reply.
27/12/23, 09:42 - User A :Wow! I can save $15 and buy this used version?!?!? How wonderful!
27/12/23, 09:48 - User B  :K... I guess I'll just take your work for it.
27/12/23, 09:48 - User C :No idea but as of last year there was a cat that liked to hang out there. Hope he‚Äôs okay ‚ù§Ô∏è
27/12/23, 10:03 - User A :Most likely. If he falls to our 3rd round pick ,I think we should definitely take him.
27/12/23, 12:00 - User B  :Your repeated need to retreat into victimhood is a snooze.
27/12/23, 13:17 - User C :And if [NAME] had any impact he would likely be playing in a 3rd next week
27/12/23, 14:14 - User A :Keep going! Every day you stick with it is another victory you can cherish!
28/12/23, 08:13 - User B  :why not play 666 games and then create a thread :thinking:
28/12/23, 13:07 - User C :I think he acted that part pretty well
28/12/23, 13:09 - User A :Tory nationalists puts nationalstic soundbite. TBH, at this stage, an endorsement from TM should be seen as implicit admission that independence is a great idea.
28/12/23, 17:40 - User B  :i have bought this but not played. i'm scared. hold me.
29/12/23, 12:13 - User C :Ah, Farmville. Those were dark days.

30/12/23, 13:06 - User B  :If they overdo it and burn themself out it may be.
30/12/23, 13:06 - User C :I love you like a love song, baby. And if you know that song, it's now in your head.

03/01/24, 23:16 - User A :The black beans were there hidden within the rice!! :) gotta love those legumes
03/01/24, 23:17 - User B  :Even a powerline adapter won't save you from the laggy mess that is SFV
04/01/24, 09:44 - User C :Me thinks you‚Äôre responding to the wrong dude. My original comment couldn‚Äôt have beeen more drenched in irony.
04/01/24, 09:47 - User A :To show themself in public like that they never did grow up. A 11 year old in a 25 year old body. Sad, really.
04/01/24, 11:06 - User B  :Maybe divorce is a little extreme but I really dont know how to Express my feelings, and she doesn't get that
04/01/24, 11:48 - User C :ATTACH THE STONE OF TRIUMPH!!
04/01/24, 20:46 - User A :He couldn't block a shot if it was from my dead grandma
04/01/24, 22:23 - User B  :I have a launch xb1 and i have maybe crashed twice since the game came out. I have almost 8 days played btw...

08/01/24, 09:31 - User C :Hahahah Someone rmb this joker from movie!
08/01/24, 09:31 - User A :What was the "injustice?" Nothing happened to him. Assuming his story was not hugely exaggerated to fit the victim card.
08/01/24, 11:42 - User B  :You also can‚Äôt prove it happened so logically this doesn‚Äôt exist and is a paradox that never happened therefore pi = 3.14159
08/01/24, 11:43 - User C :Spaceballs the suit case nuke, the kids love this one.

09/01/24, 15:44 - User A :[NAME] won it last year, even with all our goal kickers. Didn't think it would happen again with our set up.

09/01/24, 18:16 - User B  :It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. 
09/01/24, 18:19 - User C :[NAME] is a fucking trooper

11/01/24, 16:22 - User C :I just watched the entire episode. They never once hint that they were having an affair. That information didn't come from the show.

19/01/24, 21:58 - User A :I agree with the concealer part for the cut crease but that's it.
20/01/24, 11:00 - User B  :Ironic, since cleaning your room is what [NAME] is always on about.
21/01/24, 22:31 - User C :He looks like [NAME] in Jackass 2 when they glued pubes to his face.
21/01/24, 22:31 - User A :Too late. Gooble gobble, gooble gobble. We accept you. One of us.

21/01/24, 22:31 - User B  :Every time, lots of people overwhelm me. I have light sensitivity to florescents so that doesn't help. 
21/01/24, 22:31 - User C :Cheers to that, girl. ü•Ç 
22/01/24, 21:30 - User A :Yo you guys look like the couple from that Episode advertisement
22/01/24, 21:32 - User B  :When giving birth is the only thing you‚Äôve ever accomplished
22/01/24, 21:33 - User C :There are courts. You need to document all this and let the judge give him a tongue lashing. Not that that would make a difference...
22/01/24, 21:38 - User A :Debating whether this is a troll or gross overshare. Going to go with troll since you just also made a new account
22/01/24, 21:41 - User B  :NOT TODAY REINHARDT
22/01/24, 21:41 - User C :yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. 
22/01/24, 21:45 - User A :It must be really sad and lonely under your bridge troll.
22/01/24, 21:46 - User B  :Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?
22/01/24, 21:46 - User C : üé∂ Hark to the tale of [NAME], and the boy he loved so dear. They remained the best of friends for years and years and years. üé∂ 
22/01/24, 21:48 - User A :I like to think I do but idk my advice could be awful haha.
23/01/24, 08:57 - User B  :I stand corrected! But, if that's the case, who is the world's second most famous groundhog (assuming [NAME] remains #1)?
23/01/24, 10:18 - User C :Damn, that sucks.
23/01/24, 13:22 - User A :Oh the irony in the title
23/01/24, 13:22 - User B  :This is like that SNL sketch. EDIT: For anyone wondering what I‚Äôm talking about.
23/01/24, 18:11 - User C :Let's get the streak going.
23/01/24, 18:59 - User A :Okay, I'll admit it. I laughed.
23/01/24, 19:03 - User B  :> eaten out by their coach
23/01/24, 19:05 - User C :It sucks because the guy ruined the name. Also ruined a tiny mustache.
23/01/24, 19:21 - User A :TIL I learned there are no drugs or violent incidents in prisons.
23/01/24, 19:26 - User B  :Just gotta day that age gap might have something to do with this. I bet he hates that dang rap music too.
23/01/24, 19:30 - User C :I got over 900 responses, so it is taking more time that I expected, hopefully will be done by this Sunday.
23/01/24, 19:36 - User A :I've always wondered how cases where an individual gets a 7 or 8 figure sum issued against them work in practice
24/01/24, 11:49 - User B  :The FDA has plenty to criticize. But like here, it's usually criticized horribly off base. It needs to grow some balls and actually enforce things. 
24/01/24, 12:46 - User C :They're off thinking about ways they can avoid topics and deflect more, since they seem so good at that lately.
24/01/24, 16:04 - User A :Annoying isn‚Äôt it! Thanks, I guess I‚Äôll have to stop responding too!
24/01/24, 16:04 - User B  :I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.
24/01/24, 16:05 - User C :cultural norms is an interesting way of classifying the sort of people I see doing ~100% of littering in NYC.
24/01/24, 16:05 - User A :I've been watching it recently and it is such an amazing show!
24/01/24, 16:11 - User B  :Im pretty sure the 2nd song is about him too. Cant wait to get that on the PA along with the disco lights
24/01/24, 18:02 - User C :(i'm tickled to see the tag Kalamity catching on around here)
24/01/24, 18:04 - User A :Going to the doctor tomorrow for a checkup to make sure everything is normal and hopefully this shit is just in my head.
24/01/24, 18:05 - User B  :There‚Äôs tons of stories of animals taking care of kids....I believe the story! :)
24/01/24, 18:15 - User C :He has a prog rock album.. its horrific

29/01/24, 16:43 - User C :Well this is the dumbest take I‚Äôve seen on here.
29/01/24, 16:43 - User A :The men that you grew up around sound pretty insensitive. I hope that they didn‚Äôt cloud your opinion of what a typical man is like.
29/01/24, 16:45 - User B  :Well, I can't speak for the right; I'm on the left.
29/01/24, 18:45 - User C :Lol at least stand by your dumb opinion instead of deleting it.
29/01/24, 18:46 - User A :Because people want to have more than the absolute bare necessities for survival.
29/01/24, 19:17 - User B  :After I got rammed into by 2 planes on the 1st zone's storm edge in dusty, I couldn't agree more.
29/01/24, 19:36 - User C :That does not look appetizing
29/01/24, 19:38 - User A :Tiki Lounge always smells like sewage. I'm surprise it's lasted this long.
30/01/24, 07:40 - User B  :They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
30/01/24, 08:23 - User C :Maybe you‚Äôre just extremely boring and bland, and outright refuse to learn to take photos that don‚Äôt suck. 
30/01/24, 08:25 - User A :Wrong. And UBI sucks unless you include an expansive social safety net too
30/01/24, 10:26 - User B  :Ranked #3 edge defender in the NFL, 25 years old, and makes our division rival weaker

30/01/24, 12:26 - User A :Just heard the Xbox Rare Achievement sound go off in my head.
30/01/24, 12:42 - User B  :How do you prove someone is looking for a job??
30/01/24, 13:37 - User C :Basically. My step dad didn't choose to break his back and his knees. The whale chose to overeat and become obese
30/01/24, 13:42 - User A :Just imagine the waitstaff carrying cast-iron plates everywhere! oof!
30/01/24, 13:43 - User B  :I don‚Äôt love prison- I love the stuff that leads me TO prison. Get on board, [NAME].
30/01/24, 14:10 - User C :Thanks will check them out!
30/01/24, 21:01 - User A :leg-lock speaks to me in the most animalistic level
30/01/24, 21:01 - User B  :I‚Äôm so happy for you. Congrats and thanks for the advice
30/01/24, 21:01 - User C :That could have gone extremely badly for all involved.
30/01/24, 21:01 - User A :Hey man you can outline whatever excuse you want to not go ahead with this. I'm just giving you information.
31/01/24, 15:03 - User B  :The vagoo has been stretched over the bike, it allows for a comfortable and pleasurable ride, pretty innovative and cleaver way to operate a locomotive.
31/01/24, 16:17 - User C :You're creepy

02/02/24, 08:50 - User A :Yes, I am.
02/02/24, 12:32 - User B  :The best part of froyo is getting to do it yourself. Robot is useless and bad at it's job.
02/02/24, 12:34 - User C :thanks, metropolitan looks legit according to google searches. 
02/02/24, 13:23 - User A :So funny, I just watched this one today and was struck by [NAME] in the height of his coked out glory. He is absolutely so gross.

03/02/24, 10:56 - User B  :Yah a couple years been together for 7 total...we are in healthcare
03/02/24, 10:56 - User C :Did I present a braiwashing sect as something positive? Both are bad, but at least you can therapy your way out of emo.
03/02/24, 11:59 - User A :No deal then? Sick of reading about this shite.
03/02/24, 12:23 - User B  :I think I found the rom somewhere, now I just gotta set it up. I hope I can manage to do that. 
05/02/24, 08:47 - User C :I see you with Zangetsu, and I like it
05/02/24, 09:04 - User A :I think some of them expect there to be a cashier standing like a statue at every register at all times no matter how slow business is!
05/02/24, 22:52 - User B  :Looks like a badly designed [NAME] avatar
06/02/24, 08:44 - User C :Just the best WR in the league retweeting the best TE in the league, nothing to see here....

06/02/24, 21:59 - User A :You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only
06/02/24, 23:52 - User B  :Thanks very much. I'm off work in a week or so. I know where I'm heading!
07/02/24, 08:32 - User C :I like all of them, depending on what I want to learn. I really like [NAME] and [NAME] style, because they are such trolls. 
07/02/24, 08:33 - User A :Wish they would of given air vehicles some love. A lot of ace pilots hated the game.
07/02/24, 10:33 - User B  :New Houston foodies here that make Youtube videos on food primarily on Houston spots. Would love some honest feedback!
07/02/24, 13:46 - User C :This is the best Cowboy Story Arch.

08/02/24, 13:27 - User A :This was extremely helpful, many thanks!
08/02/24, 13:27 - User B  :Excuse me?
09/02/24, 10:09 - User C :[NAME] is an embarrassment to this state
09/02/24, 11:58 - User A :Goodbye my tank commander!
09/02/24, 12:00 - User B  :Op literally listed the OS requirements. Those are fairly current operating (last Gen more or less) systems are they not?
09/02/24, 13:28 - User C :ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE
09/02/24, 14:26 - User A :I dont blame you I have a stuffed otter my gf and I got in Catalina I wont even let my niece play with it
09/02/24, 15:35 - User B  :The problem with C4 wasn't that it was short, but that nothing really happened. 
09/02/24, 15:43 - User C :Probably didn't notice the bicycles until last second and swerved to avoid them.
09/02/24, 18:44 - User A :What's the streamer's name? I want to find the aftermath of this
09/02/24, 19:13 - User B  :NEVER FEAR!!! [NAME] IS HERE!!
09/02/24, 19:14 - User C :You‚Äôve never been to Oakland, Hayward, or Richmond?
12/02/24, 08:53 - User A :My [NAME] He is a BEAST. Every possession he makes someone his bitch. Are there any injury concerns past the injury he got before he left the team?
13/02/24, 08:33 - User B  :Oh my god are you [NAME]? If you are I am huge fan. I completed the IX EE earlier today using your guide
13/02/24, 21:42 - User C :There are plenty of cases of terminally ill people who elected to stop treatment and then pass away. You're not obligated to get treatment.
13/02/24, 22:34 - User A :It's satirical but also almost truth. We're the fattest nation in Western Europe and that percentage is growing.
14/02/24, 11:59 - User B  :Funny how the [NAME] leaves the most important item out of their article headline.
15/02/24, 09:12 - User C :I completely agree
15/02/24, 09:30 - User A :Fcking disgusting.
15/02/24, 09:30 - User B  :Nope, he owns Swift. It's basically a holding company for all of his business ventures
16/02/24, 08:22 - User C :As a Dolphins fan this hurts me
17/02/24, 10:01 - User A :That is even worse. No tax from them and we provide them with services.
17/02/24, 10:07 - User B  :I do this all the time and I have honestly never noticed.
17/02/24, 10:07 - User C :Dennis day. I wanna see what the [NAME] would put the Gang through.
17/02/24, 10:08 - User A :No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME]. 
17/02/24, 10:09 - User B  :Thank you, its like if you looked a camera that was taking a picture of your ear, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it.
17/02/24, 10:21 - User C :Isn‚Äôt it the worst feeling ever?
17/02/24, 10:22 - User A :Funny joke.
17/02/24, 10:32 - User B  :It' kinda ironic that "Winners" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)
17/02/24, 10:32 - User C :Is the misspelling on the cake the only thing you see wrong with this post?
17/02/24, 10:33 - User A :I'm 21 and I've slept with dozens of girls.
17/02/24, 10:36 - User B  :This guy here
17/02/24, 10:36 - User C :#I HATE BOTH EQUALLY
17/02/24, 10:48 - User A :The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...
17/02/24, 10:49 - User B  :Seems like [NAME] got shot by the **japanising beam**
17/02/24, 10:51 - User C :Step one is done! Now just to get rid of the rest of the incompetence here.
17/02/24, 10:56 - User A :These style skins remind me so much of hollow knight
17/02/24, 11:01 - User B  :This is something kids do on their twitch streams to get subs, pretty sad.
17/02/24, 11:06 - User C :It‚Äôs going to be a very long and exhausting election season. I just hope we make it though united.
17/02/24, 11:47 - User A :You'd have to explain what that means to you first. It's such a nebulous phrase it's never meant much of anything to me.
17/02/24, 11:57 - User B  :Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.
17/02/24, 12:13 - User C :Thank you! I ended up assigning a dbq and paired students up
17/02/24, 12:13 - User A :These are the same people who thought liking hot sauce was a major scandal
17/02/24, 12:14 - User B  :[NAME] already setting records for most nicknames in the league. There is no way to stop this kid...
17/02/24, 12:14 - User C :Honestly I agree. We should shun vegetarians regardless of the [NAME] thing. /s
17/02/24, 12:15 - User A :Keep branching out guys.
17/02/24, 12:16 - User B  :My son already had the surgery. He's fine.
17/02/24, 12:19 - User C :He‚Äôs had nightmares ever since the storm
17/02/24, 12:25 - User A :I would love to see some encouragement and smiles on the sideline instead of yelling and whining.
17/02/24, 12:36 - User B  :You're asking for scientific proof of spirituality. You're either very dumb, trolling, or you think I'm a charlatan.
17/02/24, 14:31 - User C :[NAME] said that it was recorded the monday after [NAME], that's why his voice is like that.
17/02/24, 14:31 - User A :Eh, it'll be alright. Just another battle scar haha. Best of luck to the both of us! 
17/02/24, 14:31 - User B  :As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you.
17/02/24, 14:32 - User C :Oh it's a well known phenomenon, unsure exactly what it is but I think it's a bit of princess syndrome with mental posho co morbidity. 
17/02/24, 14:32 - User A :Nothing of value lost then. They didn't really give a shit before so it doesn't matter now. Move on and cultivate new relationships.
17/02/24, 14:32 - User B  :[NAME] could rebound and still be overpaid, depending on how hard he rebounds.
17/02/24, 14:32 - User C :That theater is huge
17/02/24, 14:32 - User A :Trade [NAME] and see if he plays [NAME] over [NAME]. let's see what kinda coach we're dealing with here.
17/02/24, 14:32 - User B  :You're a hottie!
17/02/24, 14:32 - User C :want* a source on that, sorry.
17/02/24, 14:33 - User A :This!!!
17/02/24, 14:33 - User B  :Omg yes!
17/02/24, 14:33 - User C :Dummy I'm disagreeing with you
17/02/24, 14:34 - User A :a celebrity i like had his appendix out and tweeted about how surgery left him with an ugly belly button ü§£
17/02/24, 14:34 - User B  :[NAME] has strong ties with one person. [NAME] has strong ties with 3, maybe 4. 
17/02/24, 14:35 - User C :This is amazing, man. Kick some ass, make good food, get paid. Congratulations
17/02/24, 14:35 - User A :In the voice of [NAME] from The Office "Incorrect. You didn't *Pin* anyone"
17/02/24, 14:36 - User B  :In the letter I told her she was disrespectful and that we will not ask her to housesit again.
17/02/24, 14:36 - User C :Leave chicken in a vat of blue dye overnight and you'll lose all the pink
17/02/24, 14:36 - User A :Good luck and wear condom
17/02/24, 14:36 - User B  :And we'll be surrounded by friends
17/02/24, 14:37 - User C :Offense does too. Love [NAME] but he's hurting our spacing being out there so much.
17/02/24, 14:37 - User A :Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
17/02/24, 14:37 - User B  :Well if you read my other posts you‚Äôd know I did try to end it in a responsible mature way and he refused sooo
17/02/24, 14:37 - User C :Nah hes just setting an image.. Hes backed by ps to play this tourny...
17/02/24, 14:37 - User A :omg no way he totally screwed himself over there XD
17/02/24, 14:38 - User B  :Fuck I love you prag
17/02/24, 14:38 - User C :You're taking her scale way too literally.
17/02/24, 14:39 - User A :Having a friend helped me
17/02/24, 14:39 - User B  :You're happy that survs DC when you play killer? I'd rather actually play the game. Legion mains are weird sometimes.
17/02/24, 14:40 - User C :I did! Never moving back, I love my life in the "big smoke".
17/02/24, 14:45 - User A :I believe they shot him through the door in the back.
17/02/24, 14:47 - User B  :Just be respectful.
17/02/24, 14:48 - User C :Them boys smelling even more blood in the water. Rack them fuckin points up boys!
17/02/24, 14:50 - User A :Memes that were made 2 or more years ago don‚Äôt count. They were probably funny back then, just not now.
17/02/24, 14:50 - User B  :[NAME] isn‚Äôt the problem [NAME] is.
17/02/24, 14:51 - User C :I didn‚Äôt think of that, thank you!
17/02/24, 14:52 - User A :Actually ugly women are not going to post their pics.
17/02/24, 14:53 - User B  :[NAME] is a comedic goldmine. I don't blame comedians for milking the idiot.
17/02/24, 14:58 - User C :Thanks for sharing. Lies like this make it harder for the real ones to share and get justice
17/02/24, 15:03 - User A :I want to so bad it hurts. I guess I'm just scared.
17/02/24, 15:03 - User B  :The lads put in excellent shift over the Christmas fair dues lads. Thanks for keeping on top of things. Delighted online shopper :)
17/02/24, 15:04 - User C :Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I‚Äôd love to be surprised
17/02/24, 15:07 - User A :It's not my cousin's fault. It was actually me who set up the whole date.
17/02/24, 15:11 - User B  :‚ÄúSo a guy cusses you out for lowballing him...‚Äù
17/02/24, 15:12 - User C :The reason you keep going is the same as mine, I just don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôll get there.
17/02/24, 15:13 - User A :Surely you meant isn't. XD
17/02/24, 15:18 - User B  :I'm really considering making this my flair
17/02/24, 15:19 - User C :Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.
17/02/24, 15:19 - User A :Nope, it‚Äôs what you said. If 17 isn‚Äôt a child then what are they?
17/02/24, 15:19 - User B  :The space between the M and the E always looks a tad too long with these cheaper jerseys.
17/02/24, 15:33 - User C :Seriously. I legit laughed at this.
17/02/24, 15:37 - User A : I have worked at a shitty, south side smoke shop before so I can imagine all of these interactions perfectly hahahaha
17/02/24, 15:42 - User B  :It's an absurdly racist phrase that these anti-racist activists are very comfortable using for some reason.
17/02/24, 15:47 - User C :Source leads to artist‚Äôs Twitter page and post :3
17/02/24, 15:51 - User A :I think they're seasonal? I'm not sure, I don't buy squash so I just go by our PLU book
17/02/24, 15:52 - User B  :I want to thank them for faking my death, now that man will stop looking for me.
17/02/24, 15:53 - User C :Personally really enjoyed it. Have it in my top 3 AC games with AC2 and Black Flag in there too.
17/02/24, 16:04 - User A :It is not the ring. (I hope that you will be more relaxed now, but I‚Äôve to be honestly, it is a fucking lie)
17/02/24, 16:06 - User B  :Why should [NAME] get to pick the Democratic party candidate?
17/02/24, 16:28 - User C :Hahaha for real..
17/02/24, 16:41 - User A :Is he not supposed to have what he wants? What he needs?
17/02/24, 16:45 - User B  :Great site. Never heard of it. Thank you for passing along!
17/02/24, 16:49 - User C :I really love this suggestion. Thank you!
17/02/24, 16:54 - User A :Right! I pictured my kids and my oldest would probably MAYBE try once to show the little one.
17/02/24, 17:00 - User B  :Really? First I‚Äôve heard of it lol.
17/02/24, 17:02 - User C :I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
17/02/24, 17:03 - User A :Neither is beating people up
17/02/24, 17:03 - User B  :When I get a brain freeze, I grab my chest and throat. Very painful. Then i keep eating. 
17/02/24, 17:10 - User C :First is the worst
17/02/24, 21:07 - User A :Since you called me out for saying that I am defending the attacker, then just point out which sentence I wrote led you to that conclusion. 
19/02/24, 13:08 - User B  :For real. I can understand holding the enemy in a useless area, but people gotta keep their eye on the ball.
20/02/24, 11:51 - User C :I'd be worried about the tone, not the content.
20/02/24, 18:17 - User A :My kids graduated college two years ago. Guess I missed it?
20/02/24, 18:17 - User B  :Barely as in just this year
20/02/24, 18:17 - User C :Why are you trying to do that? What‚Äôs going on?
20/02/24, 18:19 - User A :To match the Mets green st paddy‚Äôs jerseys
20/02/24, 18:20 - User B  :That‚Äôs exactly how my fanfiction goes
20/02/24, 18:21 - User C :It's such a lol watching them trying to desperately rationalise their literalism.
20/02/24, 18:22 - User A :Oh man that hurt to watch
20/02/24, 18:22 - User B  :Left handers are rejoicing over this
20/02/24, 18:23 - User C :I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
20/02/24, 18:23 - User A :The frequency with which I hear ‚Äúgone overseas to defend our country‚Äù without a hint of irony should be criminal in itself
20/02/24, 18:23 - User B  :Yeah, I mean it's not like anyone else has ever shut down the Government.
20/02/24, 18:24 - User C :Just pick someone you like and hope for the best!
20/02/24, 18:25 - User A :GO SUB TO HIM HES THE BEST
20/02/24, 18:25 - User B  :You must be wrong, because this is the sub for intelligent people!!! 
20/02/24, 18:25 - User C :I should stop jumping in elevators.
20/02/24, 18:25 - User A :OMG, my two favorite franchises and the two best girls!!
20/02/24, 18:28 - User B  :What part of "Yeah but still" do you not understand dude?
20/02/24, 18:28 - User C :well she went to prison for **armed robbery and kidnapping** so after learning this i could hardly give a shit about her
20/02/24, 18:28 - User A :Sacramento fun as hell
20/02/24, 18:29 - User B  :SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.
20/02/24, 18:29 - User C :That's what I'd hope for! Retool the D day 1, if we could find a gem at QB day 2. 
20/02/24, 18:29 - User A :That‚Äôs nightmare fuel right there
20/02/24, 18:30 - User B  :OK, is there a crossover between herb and spice in your language (Norwegian?) I was confused by 'North American Provence spice'.
20/02/24, 18:30 - User C :Just tell her how you feel and make the next move
20/02/24, 18:30 - User A :I am unconcerned.
20/02/24, 18:30 - User B  :It was a beautiful week
20/02/24, 18:31 - User C :If you look at her from a distance, she's super cute. Then you get close and it's a [NAME] painting of tweaky, delusion.
20/02/24, 18:31 - User A :ü§£I didn't realize that the Geneva Convention covered this, but phew! I might be doing this ASAP.
20/02/24, 18:31 - User B  :it‚Äôs so weird to wear a blazer and khakis on a visit like that
20/02/24, 18:31 - User C :That's why I specified 'current attack.' I know it's gone on for ages.
20/02/24, 18:31 - User A :Thank you.
20/02/24, 18:32 - User B  :it looks like a vase to put things in!
20/02/24, 18:32 - User C :I'm concerned because I understood it as well. Is Kykko a bot?
20/02/24, 18:32 - User A :Can¬¥t believe the problem was this. Thx mate, it¬¥s solved!
20/02/24, 18:32 - User B  :That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground.
20/02/24, 18:33 - User C :I love the way you wrote this. Outstanding
20/02/24, 18:34 - User A :I'm sure your kind is fine the way it is
20/02/24, 18:34 - User B  :I dated a guy from Steamboat Springs Colorado who used to do this. He had an immune system made of steel but it was absolutely disgusting.
20/02/24, 18:35 - User C :I think this is the only place on the internet that is happy with this commercial hahaha
20/02/24, 18:35 - User A :Been to 54 countries at age 34. No debts, ever. Aiming for retirement in my early 40's. Life is good.
20/02/24, 18:37 - User B  :This article is stupid.
20/02/24, 18:37 - User C :Then believe me...he Always will be looking. It‚Äôs just the way it is with some guys.
20/02/24, 18:38 - User A :If you leave religious pamphlets that look like money instead of a tip, *you're about* ***meet*** *[NAME]...*
20/02/24, 18:39 - User B  :I‚Äôm just doing it ironically to own the libs! /s
20/02/24, 18:44 - User C :Cool, hope that helps.
20/02/24, 18:49 - User A :Except for the part where it grows in with that awful shape people make because they can only see themselves in the mirror.
20/02/24, 18:58 - User B  :[NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
20/02/24, 19:08 - User C :Whoever wrote this article has no concept of what‚Äôs going on what so ever. There assessments are miles off the mark.
20/02/24, 19:11 - User A :Oh, I've thought about it... a lot, but I just couldnt do that. Even though he really deserves it!
20/02/24, 19:11 - User B  :It's fishphobic!
20/02/24, 19:13 - User C :Glad to see you were able to get this worked out, thx for the update! 
20/02/24, 19:43 - User A :I REALLY hate this one
20/02/24, 20:14 - User B  :wow wow wow hold my beer!
20/02/24, 20:15 - User C :I haven't gone by the name [NAME] since, oh before you were born.
20/02/24, 20:37 - User A :I've been putting off scheduling a dental appointment for a week because of this, I'm just too anxious to pick up the phone and dial. 
20/02/24, 20:43 - User B  :You can make a complaint and get damages if this happens. They are required to not pester you for two years if you fill it in online.
20/02/24, 21:14 - User C :It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.
21/02/24, 15:34 - User A :Lmao there is a reason they are one of the poorest and this is definitely a contributor..
21/02/24, 15:35 - User B  :I feel truly honored that you gave up the jubilation of being the only person to see that peanut and sharing it with us
21/02/24, 15:35 - User C :Especially when it's right in your FACE
21/02/24, 15:35 - User A :No, I'm pointing to the fact that you think that without Capitalism, the only alternative reality is the Soviet Union.
21/02/24, 15:37 - User B  :Hey there [NAME] what's it like in new york city
21/02/24, 15:37 - User C :that's like a kel'thuzad/kael'thas wet dream right there. Line them up for disgusting aoe XD
21/02/24, 15:37 - User A :I would post on r/legaladvice to see if there is some way you could get back to your family and more importantly your cat!
21/02/24, 15:38 - User B  :And I taught my room was dirty and that I was not taking care of my self. Good job op
21/02/24, 15:50 - User C :He's so intimidating...
21/02/24, 16:34 - User A :Really? I love that show
21/02/24, 16:34 - User B  :So I did. Good call.
21/02/24, 16:44 - User C :Can I see the video with these two? For... research
21/02/24, 16:44 - User A :I can only assume the island is called the Spanish word for purgatory.
21/02/24, 17:05 - User B  :Yep. He also said it‚Äôd happen on a Manbij patrol
21/02/24, 19:52 - User C :Ah good call - I dont plan to take submissions for that reason
21/02/24, 19:58 - User A :Wouldn't surprise me. I only had it happen once and it was a long time ago.
22/02/24, 09:14 - User B  :She's married and I respect her family and husband too much.
22/02/24, 17:47 - User C :Lindt is premium brand, im not surprised by this.
22/02/24, 18:22 - User A :It doesn‚Äôt work as well as you‚Äôd think, but thanks either way
23/02/24, 09:46 - User B  :I admit I‚Äôll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
23/02/24, 11:56 - User C :Dang. That IVF story. I feel so badly for that woman oh my god
23/02/24, 12:25 - User A :Omg, your screen name made me lol!!
23/02/24, 12:26 - User B  :That's fair, but it's gotta suck being one round off the qualifier and then watching your teammates go anyway without you.
23/02/24, 12:28 - User C :Hiroshima is a crime against humanity
23/02/24, 13:29 - User A :How can we send money to you?
23/02/24, 13:43 - User B  :I'm definitely feeling like it's been a never ending hurting fest, so I hope you're right.
23/02/24, 17:11 - User C :This post makes me facepalm
23/02/24, 17:12 - User A :those comments are perplexing
23/02/24, 17:12 - User B  :Any one of us could be a journalist, and that level of journalism feeding the masses is mildly scary.
23/02/24, 21:28 - User C :Why do you think he's right? What reason would a nonprofit newsroom have for publishing sensationalist headlines?
25/02/24, 22:26 - User A :Funny, I don't know a single MRA who's been accused of sexual assault... but I know plenty of feminists who have...
26/02/24, 09:01 - User B  :Great to hear lol I just ordered a ton for my shop so that‚Äôs reassuring
26/02/24, 12:03 - User C :they will also hate the eagles for years to come because their fans were a bunch of meanies
26/02/24, 12:53 - User A :Have you been to one before? If so what is your experience with it? I‚Äôm nervous as hell
26/02/24, 15:50 - User B  :We tell our girl friends too when we get asked out :)
26/02/24, 15:50 - User C :Yea, very rude. Avoid anything with a strong smell like fish and popcorn, curry is just as strong. 
26/02/24, 15:50 - User A :Awesome, that's super good news :D
26/02/24, 15:53 - User B  :Somehow I got banned for replying to a troll. The mods over there have itchy trigger fingers.
27/02/24, 12:08 - User C :This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
27/02/24, 14:13 - User A :Like have an anti interventionist foreign policy.
28/02/24, 08:58 - User B  :And then everyone clapped
28/02/24, 22:13 - User C :[NAME], this is your MLA, right? Dude *does* seem like a plug. 
29/02/24, 09:04 - User A :In many states the law prosecutes the server just as harsh as the lawbreakers when it comes to alcohol. Dram shop law
29/02/24, 16:38 - User B  :No! You can't have that one! That's a coconut cake!
29/02/24, 16:42 - User C :Upset? Edit. I didn't notice anybody bring it up but I hope it isn't rude to describe [NAME] being "Yandere".
29/02/24, 16:44 - User A :because he gets fouled 70% of the time with no call
29/02/24, 16:47 - User B  :Thank you. Yeah this makes sense too. I could be blaming myself more than I should
29/02/24, 16:53 - User C :You can try, but I suspect it might be a waste of time.
29/02/24, 17:01 - User A :Who's [NAME]?
29/02/24, 17:02 - User B  :Has he done this with other world leaders, too? Or only [NAME]?
29/02/24, 17:03 - User C :I do not want to dwell into an unfruitful discussion with a troll.
29/02/24, 17:03 - User A :I love it.
29/02/24, 17:12 - User B  :not the traps
29/02/24, 17:22 - User C :This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
29/02/24, 19:17 - User A :I agree with this
29/02/24, 20:59 - User B  :Get out now!
29/02/24, 21:01 - User C :That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm terrified of.
29/02/24, 21:01 - User A :Me too buddy
29/02/24, 21:05 - User B  :Even this tweet reeks just from the description provided (and the way her friends must look/smell). I‚Äôm gagging.
29/02/24, 21:09 - User C :Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
29/02/24, 21:12 - User A :The level of envyness far too much
29/02/24, 21:18 - User B  :This should really be a libertarian/socialists for gun rights meme. I genuinely think there is a lot they have in common.
29/02/24, 21:19 - User C :I truly hope so
29/02/24, 21:26 - User A :Reading some of the stories on this sub make me appreciate my family more.
29/02/24, 22:01 - User B  :I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.
29/02/24, 23:15 - User C :I'm not sure. There's some good youtube compilations of him.
29/02/24, 23:42 - User A :If you bought it from Levi‚Äôs I think they do it for free at their flagship store
01/03/24, 10:21 - User B  :That escalated quickly
01/03/24, 11:20 - User C :[NAME] from Always Sunny is literally the best comparison for this dude. He looked a LOT like him and behaved the same way.
01/03/24, 11:22 - User A :Kids at heart.
01/03/24, 11:23 - User B  :It's gonna be somewhere between 25-30 overall, who cares
01/03/24, 11:24 - User C :I destroyed about 1/2 of them because black snakes are actually a good thing to have around. I just didn't want too many of them.
01/03/24, 11:25 - User A :They say this picture is magic. You see whatever your heart most desires.
01/03/24, 11:26 - User B  :These people project so much, I'm surprised they don't work at cinemas.
01/03/24, 14:45 - User C :Great headline though
01/03/24, 14:47 - User A :I‚Äôve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two...
01/03/24, 14:52 - User B  :So happy the new rules weren't in place back then. All those hard hits on [NAME] would have made the refs flag-happy
01/03/24, 14:53 - User C :Okay, I'll try to find one. Sorry about that.
01/03/24, 14:56 - User A :You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
01/03/24, 15:02 - User B  :If you were better than the players you met every day you would be able to get better stats while playing against them.
01/03/24, 15:04 - User C :Try to get between us and our maple syrup and see what happens
01/03/24, 15:13 - User A :This is a new level of entitlement. THE BATHROOM IS OUT OF ORDER! What makes you so entitled to use an OUT OF ORDER bathroom!
01/03/24, 15:57 - User B  :It's all greek to me
02/03/24, 07:48 - User C :I really miss AG
