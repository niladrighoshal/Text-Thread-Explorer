SRMIST has recently collaborated with ServiceNow to deliver the ServiceNow Certification Program as an industry-led elective course for the students and increase their job prospects. I have briefed about the program at the end of this mail and have also attached the related poster for your reference. 

Currently, the ServiceNow certification course has been implemented as a generic elective course (open to all departments) for the 7th semester students at KTR. 354 students have registered for this elective and the course has just started. 

Further, ServiceNow likes to extend this program and the related opportunities to other campuses. We are now working on the second batch which will include students from RMP, VDP and KTR (who missed opting it as elective). For this second batch, the course will be extended as a self-paced “On Demand Course”. The content and coverage of the On Demand Course will be the same as that of the Instructor Led Course currently offered as elective to the first batch. 

Please note that only those who have enrolled for placement will be eligible for this opportunity and Please share the final consolidated nomination list by 3.00 pm (31/07/2023).

I am herewith sharing the list of industry certification that can be done during your vacation. It is mapped role wise.

Please do a SWOC analysis and be clear on your strengths.

All students must complete atleast one industry certification by Feb 2024. It will be mapped to  your curriculum (Comprehension for third years and one component of major project for final years).

Hope you are aware that placements are not as good as last year.

Request you all to put in serious efforts to upskill yourself without wasting your time.
